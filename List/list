        <dt>Iron Man  </dt>
        <dd>ron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Co-created by writer and editor
        Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first
        appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1962 (cover dated March 1963) and received his own title with Iron Man #1 in 1968.
        Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the superhero team, the Avengers, alongside Thor,
        Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently
        since the character's creation.
        
        Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs the weapons
        manufacturing company Stark Industries. When Stark was captured in a war zone and sustained a severe heart wound, he
        built his Iron Man armor and escaped his captors. Iron Man's suits of armor grant him superhuman strength, flight,
        energy projection, and other abilities. The character was created in response to the Vietnam War as Lee's attempt to
        create a likeable pro-war character. Since his creation, Iron Man has been used to explore political themes, with early
        Iron Man stories being set in the Cold War. The character's role as a weapons manufacturer proved controversial, and
        Marvel moved away from geopolitics by the 1970s. Instead, the stories began exploring themes such as civil unrest,
        technological advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.
        
        Major Iron Man stories include "Demon in a Bottle" (1979), "Armor Wars" (1987–1988), "Extremis" (2005), and "Iron Man
        2020" (2020). He is also a leading character in the company-wide stories Civil War (2006–2007), Dark Reign (2008–2009),
        and Civil War II (2016). Additional superhero characters have emerged from Iron Man's supporting cast, including James
        Rhodes as War Machine and Riri Williams as Ironheart, as well as reformed villains, Natasha Romanova as Black Widow and
        Clint Barton as Hawkeye. Iron Man's list of enemies includes his archenemy, the Mandarin, various supervillains of
        communist origin, and many of Stark's business rivals.
        
        Robert Downey Jr. portrayed Tony Stark in Iron Man (2008), the first film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and
        continued to portray the character until his final appearance in Avengers: Endgame (2019). Downey's portrayal
        popularized the character, elevating Iron Man into one of Marvel's most recognizable superheroes. Other adaptations of
        the character appear in animated direct-to-video films, television series, and video games.

        Creation
        A portrait of Errol Flynn
        Errol Flynn was used as a reference for Tony Stark's physical appearance.
        Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of American comic books featuring
        superheroes, Marvel Comics created new superhero characters. Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man.[1] He
        wanted to design a character who should be unpalatable to his generally anti-war readers but to make them like the
        character anyway.[2] Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent arms industry developed in the United States,
        and this was incorporated into the character's backstory.[3] The character was introduced as an active player in the
        Vietnam War. Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam during Iron Man's creation as "a time when most of us
        genuinely felt that the conflict in that tortured land really was a simple matter of good versus evil".[4]
        
        Larry Lieber developed Iron Man's origin and wrote the first Iron Man story, while Jack Kirby and Don Heck were
        responsible for the initial design.[1][5] Lee modeled Iron Man after businessman Howard Hughes, invoking his physical
        appearance, his image as a businessman, and his reputation as an arrogant playboy.[6] Kirby and Heck then incorporated
        elements of the actor Errol Flynn's physical appearance in the design.[7] When first designing the character, Lee wanted
        to create a modernized Arthurian knight.[8] Kirby initially drew the Iron Man armor as a "round and clunky gray heap",
        and Heck modified the design to incorporate gadgets such as jets, drills, and suction cups.[9][10] The Iron Man
        character was created at a time when comic book characters were first depicted struggling with real-life problems, and
        his heart injury was an early example of a superhero with a physical disability.[11]
        
        Early years
        Iron Man's earliest stories were published in the monster-themed anthology series Tales of Suspense. Marvel premiered
        several superheroes this way in the 1960s as superhero comics became more popular than traditional science-fiction and
        horror comics.[9][12] Iron Man's first appearance, "Iron Man is Born!", appeared in Tales of Suspense #39, released in
        December 1962 with a March 1963 cover date.[12] Though the Iron Man armor was gray in its first appearance, Marvel
        changed it to gold because of issues with printing.[5] Lee initially delegated the writing duties to other creators at
        Marvel, but he felt their work was substandard; as with his other characters, Lee reclaimed control of Iron Man so he
        could write the stories himself.[13]
        
        Once Marvel's distributor allowed the company more monthly releases, The Avengers (1963) was developed as a new comic
        book series.[14] Iron Man was one of the five characters who formed the titular superhero team.[15] By 1965, the
        difficulty of maintaining continuity between The Avengers and the members' solo titles prompted Lee to temporarily write
        the original cast out of The Avengers, including Iron Man.[16]
        
        Heck continued as the primary Iron Man artist until 1965, as Kirby had obligations to other Marvel properties.[9][10] As
        part of a shuffling to match artists with the characters they were most suited for, Steve Ditko briefly became the
        artist for Iron Man.[17] He was responsible for only three issues in late 1963, but in this time he redesigned Iron
        Man's suit from fully gold to the red and gold color scheme that became the character's primary image.[18] Iron Man's
        recurring nemesis, the Mandarin, first appeared shortly after in Tales of Suspense #50 (1964).[19] By this time, the
        science-fiction and horror stories were phased out from Tales of Suspense, and the series ran only Iron Man and Captain
        America stories.[12] Gene Colan became the artist for Iron Man in January 1966, bringing with him an expressionist
        style.[18]
        
        For the first five years of publication, Iron Man represented the United States in Cold War allegories.[4][20] Growing
        opposition to the American involvement in Vietnam prompted a shift in Iron Man's characterization, which was part of a
        larger push by Marvel in the late 1960s to be more apolitical.[4][21] Over the years, the letters to the editor column
        in several issues saw extensive political debate.[22] Lee shifted the stories' focus to espionage and domestic crime,
        incorporating Marvel's fictional intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D. He also incorporated the villains of other Marvel
        heroes, avoiding Iron Man's primarily communist rogues' gallery and rewriting some of Iron Man's communist villains to
        have personal motivations independent of their communist allegiances.[23]
        
        Iron Man was one of several characters whom Marvel gave a full-length dedicated series in 1968.[24] Marvel combined the
        final issues of Tales of Suspense and the Sub-Mariner's Tales to Astonish into a one-shot special, Iron Man and
        Sub-Mariner.[25] Iron Man then began its run under writer Archie Goodwin.[26] Goodwin reintroduced political themes
        slowly over the following years, with a focus on domestic issues like racial conflict and environmentalism rather than
        geopolitics.[27] George Tuska started drawing the character in Iron Man #5 (1968) and intermittently served as artist
        for much of the 1970s.[28][29] In total, he drew over one hundred issues for the character.[30]
        
        1970s
        I don't feel Tony Stark is a dinosaur, a creature unable to change before the weight of time crushes him aside. Yeah, it
        is hard in 1977 to praise a millionaire industrialist, playboy and former munitions-manufacturer—but it isn't impossible
        to change that image. Which is what I plan to do.
        
        Bill Mantlo, Iron Man #100[31]
        
        When Goodwin became Marvel's editor-in-chief, he assigned Gerry Conway as the writer for Iron Man.[32] Conway was the
        first of several writers in a four-year effort to reform Iron Man, beginning in 1971, with stories that directly
        addressed the character's history as a weapons manufacturer.[33] These stories were especially prominent during a run by
        Mike Friedrich, in which corporate reform of Stark Industries was a recurring subplot.[34]
        
        Iron Man was one of several Marvel characters who declined in popularity during the 1970s, and the series went a period
        of time without a dedicated writer until Bill Mantlo took over in 1977.[35] The following year, David Michelinie and Bob
        Layton took charge of the series, beginning with issue #116.[36][37] While inking the series, Layton used issues of GQ,
        Playboy, and electronics catalogues as visual references,[38] which he and Michelinie used to stay informed on
        developments in real world technology so the Iron Man armor would always be a more advanced version of what existed.[37]
        Layton was inspired by the vast collection of specialized outfits used by Batman when designing Iron Man's various
        armors.[39][40]
        
        In Iron Man #117 and #118 (1978), Michelinie and Layton replaced many elements that developed over the series' run: they
        removed Iron Man's romantic interest Whitney Frost and Stark's robotic Life Model Decoy doubles, and they had Stark move
        to a different home.[41] They introduced Iron Man's new romantic interest, Bethany Cabe, as a feminist character who
        worked as his bodyguard.[42] Their goal was to push the character toward a more grounded, realistic portrayal.[43] The
        largest change they made was to make Iron Man an alcoholic, an unprecedented move for a major comic book hero, which led
        to the "Demon in a Bottle" story arc that ran from issues #120 to #128 (1979).[44] At the same time, they introduced the
        character Justin Hammer, who provided financial backing for several Iron Man villains.[45]
        
        1980s and 1990s
        Michelinie and Layton remained on the series until Iron Man #153 (1981).[46] Michelinie later said, "The reason I quit
        is that we felt we'd done everything with it that we'd set out to do."[47] Through the 1980s, writers for Iron Man
        focused on the character's role as a businessman, reflecting the economic changes associated with Reaganomics, and many
        of his challenges involved threats to his company.[48] Denny O'Neil was put in charge of Iron Man beginning with issue
        #158 (1982). His run explored Stark's psychology, having him relapse into alcoholism and suffer at the hands of business
        rival Obadiah Stane.[39] O'Neil wrote Stark out of the role entirely beginning with issue #170 (1983), having him
        temporarily retire as Iron Man and replacing him with his ally James Rhodes.[49] Stark was relegated as a side character
        until he returned to heroism in Iron Man #200 (1985).[50]
        
        The 1987 "Armor Wars" story arc followed Iron Man as he reclaimed his technology, which Justin Hammer distributed to
        several villains.[51] This story blended the character's superhero and businessman aspects more directly when Stark
        sought legal recourse against his rivals.[48] Michelinie and Layton returned to the series with issue #215 (1988)
        through issue #232 (1989).[46] Again, they experimented with variations on the Iron Man armor[39] and focused on down to
        Earth stories with realistic situations.[47]
        
        In 1990, Michelinie and Layton handed the series over to John Byrne, one of the most highly regarded comic book writers
        at the time. He wrote three story arcs across 20 issues: "Armor Wars II" (which had already been announced by Michelinie
        and Layton), "The Dragon Seed Saga", and "War Games".[52] Byrne revisited Iron Man's opposition to communism but
        portrayed it as less of a threat,[53] and he rewrote Iron Man's origin to remove references to communism and the Vietnam
        War. He lost interest in the series by 1992 as his collaborators John Romita Jr. and Howard Mackie had moved on to other
        projects.[52] Iron Man's supporting character War Machine was spun off into his own comic book series in 1994.[54]
        
        The Iron Man series rejected broader ideological themes by the 1990s, and individualist values replaced Stark's
        allegiance to American democracy for its own sake. He remained anti-communist, reiterating his support for democracy and
        refusing to do business in China following the Tiannamen Square Massacre in 1989.[55] The absence of Cold War politics
        was not immediately replaced by another theme, and post-Cold War Iron Man stories often explored different ideas
        regarding technology for a short time before moving on.[56] When terrorism became more prominent in the public mind,
        writers shifted Iron Man's symbolism from anti-communism to anti-terrorism.[57]
        
        As part of a company-wide reorganization in 1996, Marvel's major characters, including Iron Man, were given to former
        Marvel writers Jim Lee and Rob Liefeld in a profit-sharing agreement. Lee and Liefeld were given charge of the "Heroes
        Reborn" branding that renumbered Marvel's long-running periodicals at issue #1.[58] This new Iron Man series, labeled
        volume two, was set in an alternate universe created during the "Onslaught" event. It ran for 13 issues, written by Lee
        and Scott Lobdell and drawn by Whilce Portacio.[59][60] The following year, Marvel introduced the "Heroes Return" event
        to bring the characters back from the alternate universe, which again reset characters such as Iron Man to issue
        #1.[61][62] Kurt Busiek became the writer for volume three while Sean Chen was the artist.[59][63]
        
        2000s
        When the Ultimate Marvel imprint was created with reimagined versions of Marvel's characters, an alternate Iron Man
        appeared in 2002 with the Ultimates, the imprint's adaptation of the Avengers.[64] Marvel released a five-issue limited
        series, Ultimate Iron Man, featuring this character in 2005.[65]
        
        Iron Man represented an attempt to define what a superhero was in the 21st century, following the September 11 attacks,
        implicitly likening the fear of terrorism to the fear of unregulated super-powered beings.[66] In 2004, Iron Man was a
        major character in the Avengers Disassembled event and subsequently became a founding member of the New Avengers.[67]
        Iron Man volume four began in 2005,[59] with Warren Ellis as the writer and Adi Granov as the artist. Its first story
        arc, "Extremis", saw Iron Man upgrade his body directly through the Extremis virus, giving him direct control over a
        biological armor.[65] The volume's first 14 issues carried the Iron Man title, while issues #15–32 (2007–2008) were
        titled Iron Man: Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.[59]
        
        Iron Man led the pro-registration faction during the 2006 Civil War crossover event by Mark Millar and Steve
        McNiven.[68] In an allegory for the Patriot Act and government surveillance, Iron Man's pro-registration faction
        represented conservative support for government surveillance in the name of security and stood against Captain America's
        anti-registration faction that represented individualism and liberal opposition to government surveillance.[69] Iron Man
        believed in pragmatically choosing the lesser of two evils, whereas Captain America held an idealist approach, and both
        held these positions at great personal cost.[70] While Marvel was neutral between the characters, readers overwhelmingly
        saw Iron Man as the villain, being the stronger force that the underdog had to overcome.[71][72]
        
        Iron Man appeared with the Mighty Avengers in 2007,[73] and his characterization in this era leaned into his identity as
        a futurist.[74] Marvel restarted Iron Man's comic book run with Invincible Iron Man in 2008, written by Matt Fraction
        and drawn by Salvador Larroca.[75] This series launched around the same time as the film Iron Man premiered,[76] and the
        Marvel Cinematic Universe developed while this run was in publication.[75]
        
        2010s and 2020s
        The Iron Man series reverted to the original numbering in 2011, when the overall 500th issue was published as Iron Man
        #500.[59] A concurrent series, Iron Man Legacy by Fred Van Lente, was launched in 2010 leading up to the release of the
        film Iron Man 2.[76] Iron Man was then one of several characters whose series was relaunched at issue #1 with the Marvel
        Now! branding following the 2012 Avengers vs. X-Men event,[77] written by Kieron Gillen.[78] The 2014 "AXIS" event led
        into the Superior Iron Man series by Tom Taylor, featuring Iron Man with a new reversed personality.[79]
        
        A portrait of Brian Michael Bendis
        Brian Michael Bendis wrote several Iron Man stories in the 2010s.
        A new Invincible Iron Man run written by Brian Michael Bendis and drawn by David Marquez began in 2015.[80] A
        simultaneous Iron Man series, International Iron Man, ran for seven issues in 2016 under Marvel's All-New, All-Different
        Marvel branding, also by Bendis. This series was meant to ensure Iron Man's status as a major character as All-New,
        All-Different developed.[81] A second Civil War event in 2016 portrayed Iron Man as an advocate of free will against
        Captain Marvel's determinism.[82]
        
        As part of a broader trend by Marvel Comics to substitute its main characters with a diverse cast of original characters
        in the 2010s, Iron Man was temporarily replaced by Ironheart, a teenaged African-American girl who reverse-engineered
        the Iron Man armor, in 2016.[83] At the same time, the series Infamous Iron Man began publication with Dr. Doom as Iron
        Man.[84]
        
        The series Tony Stark: Iron Man premiered in 2018 with the Fresh Start branding, written by Dan Slott and drawn by
        Valerio Schiti.[85] In 2020, Iron Man was relaunched in a new series, written by Christopher Cantwell and illustrated by
        CAFU, following the "Iron Man 2020" event. This series moved away from the developments and deviations made to Stark's
        character introduced over the previous years—including the more extravagant science fiction and soap opera
        plots—creating a clean slate for new story arcs in a traditional superhero setting.[86] The character was relaunched
        again in 2022 with Invincible Iron Man, written by Gerry Duggan and illustrated by Juan Frigeri.[87] A new volume was
        launched in October 2024, written by Spencer Ackerman and illustrated by Julius Ohta.[88]
        
        Characterization
        Fictional character biography
        A comic book cover featuring Iron Man in a simple gray suit of armor
        Iron Man debuts in Tales of Suspense #39 (March 1963). Cover art by Jack Kirby and Don Heck.
        Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was born in Long Island, New York. As a child, he inherited his family's business, Stark
        Industries when his parents were killed in a car crash.[89] Developing equipment for the U.S. military, he travels to a
        war zone to conduct a weapons test when he triggers a booby trap. His heart is critically injured by shrapnel, and he is
        captured by the communist Wong-Chu, who demands Stark build him a weapon. Stark instead builds a suit of armor that
        sustains his heart, becoming Iron Man.[18][9] The war zone Stark visited was changed retroactively multiple times by
        different writers to correspond with the character's age, which is explained by a "sliding scale of continuity" in which
        the timing of significant events in the world of Marvel may change. This conflict was the Vietnam War for the first
        decades of Iron Man's publication history.[90] This was changed to an unnamed Southeast Asian country in the 1990s,[91]
        and a conflict in the fictional country Siancong was ultimately created to justify the inconsistency.[92]
        
        Iron Man returns to the United States and becomes a superhero, convincing the public Iron Man is Stark's bodyguard.[89]
        When he is called to stop the Hulk and learns Loki is behind the Hulk's attack, he joins forces with the Hulk, Thor,
        Ant-Man, and the Wasp to defeat Loki, and they agree to form a superhero team, the Avengers.[15] He also helps found the
        intelligence agency S.H.I.E.L.D., providing the organization with equipment.[89] Iron Man then undergoes surgery to
        replace the damaged portions of his heart, eliminating the need for his prosthetic chest plate.[93] As he came to regret
        his involvement in weapons manufacturing, Stark Industries is changed to Stark International, an electronics company
        that emphasizes environmentalism and ending world hunger.[94][89] S.H.I.E.L.D. attempts to take over the business and
        return it to weapons manufacturing. At the same time, Iron Man is framed for murder. These stresses cause him to begin
        drinking, and he develops alcoholism.[95] Though he gets sober, he relapses due to a plot orchestrated by his business
        rival Obadiah Stane.[89] Iron Man briefly loses his company to Stane, passes the Iron Man mantle to his ally James
        Rhodes,[49] and becomes homeless.[93] After Stark recovers, Stane adopts an armored suit and becomes the Iron Monger
        before being defeated. Iron Man then founds a space technology company, Stark Enterprises. When Iron Man learns Justin
        Hammer had acquired the Iron Man armor's technology, he seeks out all the other armors. The resulting fights leave Iron
        Man a fugitive, leading him to fake his death and then describe himself as a new Iron Man.[89]
        
        When Iron Man is shot in the spine and paralyzed, he develops a new prosthesis that grants him mobility. This prosthesis
        is hacked and controlled remotely, causing neurological damage that appears for a time to kill him.[96] Rhodes
        temporarily becomes Stark's chosen successor as Iron Man. After returning, Immortus places Stark under his control and
        turns him evil. The Avengers bring an alternate Tony Stark from another reality to help defeat him. Iron Man is killed
        and the alternate Tony Stark becomes the new Iron Man, but Franklin Richards merges both versions into a single being
        when he rewrites reality. Stark's company was bought out at this point, so he started a consulting firm, Stark
        Solutions. His secret identity is revealed to the public shortly afterwards. He is then appointed Secretary of Defense
        until the Scarlet Witch alters his mind, causing him to behave drunkenly at the United Nations and leave in
        disgrace.[89] When Mallen becomes a threat through the Extremis project, Iron Man has Maya Hansen inject him with the
        Extremis virus, giving him a biological armor he can control with his mind.[97]
        
        Iron Man serves as the Superhero Registration Act's enforcer upon its enactment, creating a schism between superheroes,
        with Iron Man leading proponents of registration against a group of resistors led by Captain America.[68] After the
        conflict, Iron Man becomes head of S.H.I.E.L.D.[98] The government dismantles S.H.I.E.L.D. after it fails to prevent an
        alien invasion, but Iron Man refuses to turn over the list of registered heroes to its corrupt successor agency
        H.A.M.M.E.R.[99] This agency is dismantled as well, and Iron Man organizes the Avengers to replace these agencies.[89]
        He founds a clean energy company, Stark Resilient, and fakes his death so his enemies will not threaten it. He joins the
        Guardians of the Galaxy for a time, and upon returning to Earth, he discovers he had actually been adopted by the Starks
        so their biological son could be hidden from an alien threat.[100]
        
        While fighting Red Skull, a spell cast by Victor von Doom and the Scarlet Witch temporarily inverts the personalities of
        several heroes. The new morally corrupt Iron Man protects himself from the counterspell and takes over San Francisco to
        augment the residents with Extremis.[101] When a man is discovered who can see the future, the superhero community
        undergoes another schism, and Iron Man leads a team of heroes opposed to a predetermined justice system based on his
        ability.[82] The battle ends with Iron Man in a coma. A reformed Victor von Doom becomes Iron Man, while an artificial
        intelligence backup of Stark's mind guides a new armored superhero, Ironheart. Stark resumes his work as Iron Man after
        the technology in his body allows him to heal.[100] He then allies with Emma Frost and marries her to set a trap for
        their mutual enemy Feilong.[102]
        
        Personality and motivations
        We really thought about how we needed to give him a weakness. It wasn't hip to have him running out of energy and
        looking for a light socket every few pages, or having a heart attack every time Ultimo was fighting him. So we discussed
        it and we thought that we would give him the corporate man's disease [alcoholism]. Something that would always haunt
        him.

        Iron Man is a businessman and entrepreneur who seeks to innovate and improve his technology,[6][104] both for society's
        benefit and his own.[105][106] Iron Man is one of many Marvel heroes with a genius-level intellect,[107] but his focus
        on societal application alongside hard science distinguishes him from other heroes.[107] The character is a futurist,
        and he works to identify solutions for problems that have yet to emerge. This preemptive problem-solving was a driving
        force in his organization of the Avengers and later in his support for the Superhero Registration Act during the Civil
        War event.[108]
        
        Stark's intelligence and engineering skills allowed him to construct the Iron Man armor, and he believes this justifies
        his authority over the armor and who uses it.[109] While Iron Man sometimes develops equipment for other superheroes, he
        is selective about who can use the armor, trusting only a few close allies.[110] In the 2008 story "The Five
        Nightmares", Iron Man narrates his five greatest fears: relapse into alcoholism, reproduction of the Iron Man
        technology, other people becoming Iron Man, the technology becoming disposable, and that someone else would be
        distributing this technology. Besides the danger such scenarios pose, they all represent fear of losing power over
        himself or his technology.[111]
        
        Iron Man finds machines easier to interact with than humans, believing machines can be more easily controlled and
        repaired.[89] This leads him to engage in self-destructive behavior, giving his relationships as Tony Stark lower
        priority and failing to be accountable for his creations as Iron Man.[112] His isolation comes to him from two
        directions, with both his celebrity status and his role as Iron Man making personal relationships difficult.[113]
        Through both poor decisions and bad luck, he is unable to maintain romantic relationships despite his wealth and
        talents.[114] Writer Dennis O'Neil described the Iron Man armor as "a psychological crutch preventing him from dealing
        with his own inner demons".[39] He identifies with the Iron Man armor as an extension of himself, believing the image it
        presents is his own image, and he considers himself responsible any time someone uses the technology.[115]
        
        Iron Man behaves differently as a superhero and as a civilian, engaging in courageous and selfless acts as Iron Man but
        morally ambiguous behavior as Stark.[116] The character represents a traditional understanding of American masculinity
        as a businessman and a playboy, particularly as it was seen in the Cold War.[117][118] This characterization also
        manifests in negative traits that were prominent in early Iron Man stories, including belligerence, negligence, and
        misogyny.[119] Stark has several character flaws emerging from his impulsivity and arrogance, engaging in vices that
        include excessive drinking, partying, and womanizing.[120][116][121]
        
        Iron Man's heart injury was prominent in his early characterization, causing him to isolate himself so as not to reveal
        his injury or his secret identity.[10] This weakness was a threat to his autonomy and his masculinity.[122] As
        real-world medical technology made heart injuries less fatal, writers introduced neurological damage[123] and alcoholism
        as other medical weaknesses.[124][125] Despite this, Iron Man considers himself lucky and believes he lives "a good
        life", attributing this to his money, friendships, engineering skills, and recovering health.[126]
        
        Iron Man's belief in progress sometimes manifests as opposition to the press and politicians, whose attempts to keep him
        accountable hamper his efforts as a superhero.[127] He is conflicted between his support for the rule of law and his
        moral beliefs in doing what he feels must be done for the greater good. When he engages in unsanctioned attacks against
        those who co-opted his technology in the "Armor Wars" story, he describes it as "a tough decision; perhaps the toughest
        in my life".[128] The character's morally ambiguous nature can make him more accessible to readers relative to other
        superheroes who are more inherently virtuous.[129][130]
        
        Themes and motifs
        Politics and economics
        Iron Man was more overtly political than other Silver Age Marvel characters.[131] Lee wrote the character to represent
        liberal capitalism, fighting against communism and other anti-democratic forces.[132][133][134] Though anti-communist
        sentiments were present throughout Marvel Comics, they appeared most prominently in Iron Man stories.[135] After Marvel
        shifted away from addressing foreign conflicts toward the end of the 1960s, Iron Man was portrayed as a liberal who was
        skeptical of the U.S. government, yet also opposed radicalism; at the time associated with 1960s counterculture.[136]
        Marvel portrayed Iron Man as more self-doubting, questioning when the use of force is justified against
        communism.[137][138] By 1975, Iron Man opposed the Vietnam War,[136] which gave the character a new motivation in making
        up for his promotion of violence in the past.[139] Iron Man's use of his vast resources as a protector was reframed as a
        cautionary tale, in which these resources could be co-opted to do harm. His motivation for providing weapons to the
        government was retroactively changed so Stark only got involved because he believed it would end the war more
        quickly.[140] Over time, writers portrayed Iron Man as a philanthropist.[141]
        
        The dual role of Iron Man and Tony Stark allows for the examination of both the perspective of an individual inventor
        and that of the bureaucracy of governments and corporations, respectively.[142] His business Stark Industries is
        depicted as a force for good that advances scientific knowledge through capitalist innovation.[106] The Iron Man persona
        itself, as well as the technology Iron Man uses, are proprietary assets owned by Stark Industries.[143] Reflecting his
        characterization as a businessman, Iron Man stories often invoke themes of economic competition, seeing him face
        characters who try to develop better versions of the Iron Man armor.[144] Many of Iron Man's challenges involve corrupt
        business rivals and corporate espionage.[53]
        
        Technology
        Technology and its influence on society are common themes in Iron Man stories,[29][145] and various writers have
        portrayed him as a technological marvel since his earliest appearances.[146] The character's use of technology, both as
        a weapons manufacturer and as Iron Man, explores problems that arise from progress and advancement,[147] including
        misuse of technology and the implications of cybernetics.[148] Iron Man's position within the suit allows for discussion
        regarding automation versus human oversight of technology,[149] and it reflects the debate on how new technologies are
        incorporated into public and military use, including the use of exoskeletons and battle suits.[150] These technological
        themes are explored through a modern lens during the "Extremis" story arc, which incorporates the idea of human
        enhancement through biotechnology.[151][152]
        
        Depictions of technology in Iron Man stories have often endorsed its use to alter the natural world.[153] This is in
        contrast with Silver Age Marvel stories, where radiation and other technological advancements were portrayed as
        dangerous.[106][154] Iron Man's engineering talent is key to his heroism, unlike other heroes who use engineering to
        supplement superhuman abilities.[155] This makes it more plausible that something like Iron Man could exist in the real
        world, as it is only technological advancement that separates Iron Man from reality.[156][157] Iron Man's power of
        flight is especially significant in the technology's symbolism, as it associates traditional heroic imagery with a
        technological component, giving this power to a man who created it himself in a transcendental fashion.[158]
        
        Armor
        Main article: Iron Man's armor
        Several versions of Iron Man in a group; four wear red and gold armor, two wear red and silver armor, two wear all-gold
        armor, and one wears blue armor
        Variations of the Iron Man armor from Iron Man #258.1 (May 2013). Variant cover art by Bob Layton.
        Iron Man does not have any superhuman abilities. Instead, he derives his strength from a powered armor of his own
        design.[159] The armor is equipped with various weapons, which include "repulsor rays" in each palm that project
        particle beams as well as a stronger "unibeam" on his chest.[99] As of 2010, Marvel described Iron Man's armor as being
        able to lift 100 tons and to fly at Mach 8.[99]
        
        Marvel initially depicted the armor as powered by transistors,[18] but this was replaced with integrated circuits as
        real-world technology advanced.[160] New designs have further miniaturized the technology, ultimately incorporating
        nanotechnology.[161] Developments in the armor's design often reflect real-world advances in technology and trends in
        science fiction.[162] The changing nature of the armor allows artists to make frequent changes to the character's
        appearance without controversy.[145] Iron Man has also created specialized models for specific purposes,[163] including
        space armor, stealth armor, and deep sea armor,[164] as well as the Hulkbuster armor to engage in combat with the
        Hulk.[163]
        
        Prior to Iron Man's surgery, the armor's primary function was to produce a magnetic field that protected his heart from
        the shrapnel in his body. His efforts to keep it charged and to keep it secret drove the story's plot.[165] From its
        first appearance, Stark has controlled the armor by linking it to his brainwaves,[166] and he must calibrate it to any
        allies who use it.[167] The armor is often shown to have some method of shrinking it down to make it portable when not
        being used.[168]
        
        Iron Man stories contrast the armor's strength and the vulnerability of the human inside it.[169][165] The armor
        protects Iron Man externally from attacks, but it also protected him internally when it kept his heart beating.[166] The
        form-fitting design of many Iron Man armors emphasizes this with a human figure in an otherwise robotic-looking
        character.[132]
        
        During the "Extremis" story arc, Iron Man adopted a biotechnological armor embedded in his DNA and stored in his bones.
        This allowed him to summon the armor from within his body and control it with his mind, effectively giving him
        superhuman abilities. This reduced the input lag between his brain and his armor, allowed him to mentally interface with
        any technology in the world, and gave him the focus to engage in several unrelated tasks at once.[170][171][172] The
        Extremis technology also converted Iron Man's mind into a digital storage device to create a back up of his memories. It
        also presented a weakness, as Iron Man's archnemesis Mandarin was able to access and manipulate the data.[101] Iron Man
        gave up the Extremis armor after it was compromised with a computer virus by the Skrulls, who used it to disable Earth's
        defenses during an invasion.[173]
        
        Supporting characters
        Allies
        Main article: List of Iron Man supporting characters
        Pepper Potts is a Stark Industries employee who Stark promoted to his executive assistant.[174] The original portrayal
        of the character was that of a simple love interest and damsel in distress.[114] She came to manage the business
        herself, as Stark had little interest in his responsibilities.[174] When Stark became Iron Man and took responsibility
        for his company, she taught him how to manage the business.[89] When Pepper was injured by an explosion and received a
        heart injury similar to Iron Man's, he installed the arc reactor technology in her.[175] She eventually became the CEO
        of Stark Industries.[176] Iron Man secretly worked on a suit of armor to be powered by her arc reactor, and she
        discovered it in a Stark Industries lab while she had control of the company. Taking the armor, she became the superhero
        Rescue.[177]
        
        James Rhodes was an employee of Stark's.[57] He first appeared in 1979 and was developed as a supporting character in
        1981.[178] He briefly became Iron Man while Stark was relapsing on alcoholism.[49] Later on, when Stark was near death,
        he gave Rhodes his corporation and the War Machine armor.[179] Stark let Rhodes keep the armor, and Rhodes became the
        superhero War Machine.[180] Rhodes' dependency on Iron Man for his armor often constrains him as a supporting character
        to Stark, even in solo War Machine stories.[181]
        
        Happy Hogan was hired as Stark's chauffeur after saving his life, and Happy later deduced Stark was Iron Man.[182] Iron
        Man has other allies through his affiliation with the Avengers, including close personal relationships with Captain
        America, Ant-Man, and the Wasp.[183] As Tony Stark, he is the benefactor of the Avengers, providing their headquarters
        at Avengers Mansion.[184] Stark's butler, Edwin Jarvis, works for both Iron Man and the Avengers.[185] During a period
        without Pepper, Stark hired a new secretary, Mrs. Arbogast.[186] Iron Man is also supported by his artificial
        intelligence companions Jocasta[185] and F.R.I.D.A.Y.[101] His association with S.H.I.E.L.D. sees him working with its
        agents and leadership, including Nick Fury and Maria Hill.[176] He has taken on other heroes as sidekicks, including
        Spider-Man and Jack of Hearts.[89]
        
        Other characters in the Marvel Universe have taken up the Iron Man mantle besides Stark, including James Rhodes[49] and
        Victor von Doom.[100] The Iron Man armor itself came to life in the "Mask in the Iron Man" storyline, becoming violent
        before sacrificing itself to save Stark's life.[187][188]
        
        Romantic interests
        Iron Man has had many romantic interests, most of which only last a short time.[89] In the original Tales of Suspense
        run, Lee established a love triangle in which Stark and Happy were both romantically interested in Pepper.[189][10]
        Happy eventually married Pepper.[182] The series then introduced Roxie Gilbert, the sister of the villain Firebrand, as
        a romantic interest in the early 1970s. She was a foil for both Iron Man and Firebrand, representing non-violent
        activism.[190]
        
        The women associated with Iron Man became more independent as second-wave feminism encouraged Marvel's writers to create
        stronger female characters.[191] Whitney Frost was Iron Man's romantic interest later in the 1970s until she turned
        against him as the villain Madame Masque.[41][192] Bethany Cabe became Stark's love interest in 1978 as part of an
        overhaul of Iron Man's supporting cast, and she supported him during his period of alcoholism.[95] Michelinie chose to
        remove Pepper as a love interest in favor of Cabe because he felt that Iron Man would be more interested in a strong
        woman.[186] She left Iron Man after he saved her husband, who was presumed dead.[89]
        
        Stark was seduced by Indries Moomji, who was hired by Obadiah Stane to help ruin Stark, first appearing in issue #163
        (1982).[193] He later partnered with Rumiko Fujikawa, the daughter of a businessman who took over Stark Enterprises.[89]
        Stark also began a relationship with his long time ally Janet van Dyne, the Wasp,[100] whom he had briefly dated in the
        past before she learned he was Iron Man.[89] A story arc in September 2023 saw Iron Man married to X-Men member Emma
        Frost as part of a plan to defeat the villain Feilong.[102]
        
        Villains
        Main article: List of Iron Man enemies
        Iron Man's earliest villains were often affiliated with the Soviet government or otherwise associated with
        communism.[194] In the first three years after Iron Man was created, one-third of his villains were communists.[195]
        Some of these enemies were Soviet counterparts of Iron Man, such as Titanium Man[131] and Crimson Dynamo,[196] while
        others held leadership positions in communist states, such as the Red Barbarian and the real-life Soviet leader Nikita
        Khrushchev.[194] Khrushchev, like most communists in the series, was drawn in caricature style as a brute who only
        sought power.[197] Multiple communist villains, such as Crimson Dynamo, reformed and became heroes loyal to the United
        States to present Iron Man and liberal capitalism as more appealing and morally superior.[198] Two prominent Marvel
        heroes, Soviet spy Black Widow and American street criminal Hawkeye, were introduced as Iron Man villains before
        reforming as heroes.[199][200]
        
        Marvel introduced the Mandarin as a Chinese villain, incorporating racist Yellow Peril themes and stereotypes regarding
        China.[201][202] Though he is an allegory for autocracy,[203] the Mandarin was not created as another communist
        villain.[204] Instead, any work he does with the Chinese government is purely in self-interest.[205] Later on, the
        Mandarin was retroactively established as the man behind the kidnapping that created Iron Man.[91] The Mandarin
        contrasts with Iron Man through his association with magic and mysticism instead of science and technology,[206][205]
        and because he was born into nobility unlike Iron Man, who is a self-made man in line with American ideals.[203]
        
        Beginning in the 1970s, Iron Man faced villains who represented social conflict and unrest, such as the anarchist
        Firebrand and the corrupt businessman Guardsman.[207] He also faced villains representing concerns about technology,
        such as Ultimo.[208] Stark's business pursuits have invited several supervillains who oppose Stark Industries instead of
        just Iron Man.[180] These villains became prominent in the 1980s,[209] and they were amplified by backlash to
        consumerism that emerged in the 1990s.[53] Some of these villains wish to compete with the corporation and steal trade
        secrets, such as Spymaster, Whiplash, and Beetle. Others oppose the corporation on ideological grounds, such as
        Atom-Smasher.[180]
        
        Tony Stark's chief business rival is Obadiah Stane. Stark's application of business as an altruistic pursuit is
        contrasted with Stane's application as a selfish pursuit.[134] Justin Hammer was introduced as another businessman to be
        Tony Stark's antithesis. Unlike Stark, Hammer avoids public attention and provides equipment for other villains instead
        of using it himself.[210] Other major villains include Shockwave, the Controller, the Mauler, and Stilt-Man.[209] A
        focus on terrorism introduced villains such as Zeke Stane, the son of Obadiah Stane who carried out terrorist attacks
        using suicide bombers.[211]
        
        Alternate versions
        Other versions of Iron Man exist in other universes as part of Marvel's multiverse. In the Ultimate Universe, an
        alternate version of Iron Man exists as a member of the Ultimates, the universe's counterpart of the Avengers.[212] Iron
        Man 2020 is the superhero persona of Tony's cousin-once-removed Arno Stark, who is from an alternate future in which
        superheroes vanished in the 1980s. After becoming Iron Man, Arno traveled back in time to the primary Marvel
        Universe.[213]
        
        Reception and legacy
        Iron Man's appearances in the 1960s saw mixed reception from readers, many of whom criticized the character for his
        association with the United States military and the controversial Vietnam War.[4][22] In response, Marvel rewrote the
        character in the 1970s to moderate his image and to have him directly reflect on his culpability in the harms caused by
        war.[33][137] According to Lee, Iron Man was the most popular hero when reading fanmail from female readers, which he
        attributed to both the character's charisma and his tragic nature.[214]
        
        Many stories featuring the character have achieved critical acclaim. "Demon in a Bottle" in Iron Man #120–129 (1979) is
        celebrated as the definitive Iron Man story for exploring the depth of his character through his alcoholism. "Doomquest"
        in #149–150 (1981) is a popular favorite for its lighter tone and its establishment of a rivalry between Iron Man and
        Doctor Doom. "Armor Wars" in #225–232 (1987–1988) is credited for developing Iron Man's personality as someone willing
        to be more aggressive at the expense of his alliances and public trust. "Extremis" in Iron Man Vol. 4 #1–6 (2005–2006)
        is recognized as a landmark for a new modern era of Iron Man comics.[215][216][217][218] Other celebrated stories
        include "Deliverance" in Iron Man #182 (1984), the "Iron Monger Saga" in Iron Man #190–200 (1984–1985), and "World's
        Most Wanted" in Invincible Iron Man #8–19 (2009).[215][216][218] Iron Man's characterization in Civil War (2006–2007)
        was received negatively, with most readers seeing him as the villain.[219]
        
        Iron Man became widely popular following the success of the 2008 film Iron Man, which made him one of Marvel's most
        recognizable characters,[1] and the film is credited with redefining the superhero film genre.[220][221] Since then,
        many publishers have listed Iron Man among the top ten in lists of best superheroes and best Marvel
        characters.[222][223] Iron Man's portrayal of futuristic technology has affected public image of how these technologies
        may develop. Heavy use of augmented reality interfaces by Iron Man, in his helmet's heads-up display and elsewhere, has
        informed public awareness of the technology.[224] In 2019, a statue representing the character in his Iron Man armor was
        erected in Forte dei Marmi, Italy, to memorialize the character's actions in Avengers: Endgame (2019) and as a reminder
        that "the future of humanity depends on our decisions ... that all of us must be heroes!".[225]

        In 2008, a film adaptation titled Iron Man was released, starring Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark and directed by Jon
        Favreau. Iron Man was met with positive reviews from film critics,[226] grossing $318 million domestically and $585
        million worldwide, and became the first in the long-running Marvel Cinematic Universe.[227] Downey's casting was
        praised, as was his portrayal of the character; Downey's own recovery from substance abuse was seen as creating a
        personal connection with the character.[228] Downey reprises his role in Iron Man 2 (2010), Marvel's The Avengers
        (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming
        (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).[229] Iron Man supporting characters are set to
        appear in their own Marvel Cinematic Universe titles, Ironheart and Armor Wars.[230]
        
        Iron Man's first animated appearance was in a segment of the 1966 series The Marvel Super Heroes, which adapted comic
        book drawings into animations, and has since been featured in the animated series Iron Man (1994–1996) and Iron Man:
        Armored Adventures (2009–2012). He also made many appearances in other Marvel animated programs, particularly those
        featuring the Avengers, and there have been multiple Iron Man direct-to-video releases.[231]
        
        Iron Man has featured in several video games, including Iron Man (2008) and Iron Man 2 (2010), which were released as
        adaptations of his Marvel Cinematic Universe films. He also featured in the PlayStation VR game Iron Man VR (2020). An
        Iron Man action-adventure game was announced in 2022 to be developed by Motive Studio. He also appeared in many other
        Marvel video games, such as those featuring the Avengers.[232]

        <dd>Batman[b] is a superhero who appears in American comic books published by DC Comics. Batman was created by the artist
        Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and debuted in the 27th issue of the comic book Detective Comics on March 30, 1939. In
        the DC Universe, Batman is the alias of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and industrialist who
        resides in Gotham City. His origin story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after witnessing the murder
        of his parents, Thomas and Martha, as a child, a vendetta tempered by the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically
        and intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham streets at night. Kane, Finger, and other
        creators accompanied Batman with supporting characters, including his sidekicks Robin and Batgirl; allies Alfred
        Pennyworth and James Gordon; love interest Catwoman; and foes such as the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, and his
        archenemy, the Joker.
        
        Kane conceived Batman in early 1939 to capitalize on the popularity of Superman; although Kane frequently claimed sole
        creation credit, Finger substantially developed the concept from a generic superhero into something more bat-like. They
        drew inspiration from pulp fiction characters like the Shadow and Sherlock Holmes. Batman received a spin-off
        publication, Batman, in 1940. Kane and Finger introduced Batman as a ruthless vigilante who frequently killed or maimed
        criminals, but he evolved into a just, tempered superhero with a stringent moral code that prohibits killing during the
        1940s. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any superpowers, instead relying on his intellect, fighting
        skills, and wealth. The 1960s Batman television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with
        Batman for years after it ended. Various creators worked to return Batman to his darker roots in the 1970s and 1980s,
        culminating with the 1986 miniseries The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller.
        
        DC has featured Batman in many comic books, including comics published under its imprints such as Vertigo and Black
        Label; he has been considered DC's flagship character since the 1990s. The longest-running Batman comic, Detective
        Comics, is the longest-running comic book in the United States. Batman is frequently depicted alongside other DC
        superheroes, such as Superman and Wonder Woman, as a member of organizations such as the Justice League and the
        Outsiders. In addition to Bruce Wayne, other characters used the Batman persona, such as Jean-Paul Valley / Azrael in
        the 1993–1994 "Knightfall" story arc; Dick Grayson, the first Robin, from 2009 to 2011; and Jace Fox, the son of Wayne's
        ally Lucius, since 2021.[4] DC has also published comics featuring alternate versions of Batman, including the
        incarnation seen in The Dark Knight Returns and its successors, the incarnation from the Flashpoint (2011) event, and
        numerous interpretations in comics published under the Elseworlds label.
        
        Batman is one of the most iconic characters in popular culture and has been listed among the greatest comic book
        superheroes and characters ever created. He is one of the most commercially successful superheroes, and his likeness has
        been licensed and featured in various media and merchandise sold around the world; this includes toy lines such as Lego
        Batman and video games such as the Batman: Arkham series. Batman has been adapted in many live-action and animated
        television series and films. Adam West portrayed him in the 1960s Batman television series, and he has been portrayed in
        film by Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Christian Bale, Ben Affleck, and Robert Pattinson. Many actors, most
        prolifically Kevin Conroy, have provided Batman's voice in animation and video games. In September 2024, Batman was
        given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, being the first superhero to receive the honor.
        
        Publication history
        Main article: Publication history of Batman
        Creation and early history
        In early 1939, following the success of Superman, DC Comics' editors requested more superheroes.[5] Bob Kane created
        Batman, initially drawing a character with red tights, bat wings, and a domino mask. Bill Finger, a collaborator, made
        significant contributions by suggesting a cowl, cape, gloves, and a darker costume.[6] The character's alter ego, Bruce
        Wayne, was inspired by historical figures Robert the Bruce and Mad Anthony Wayne.[7] Batman's early adventures drew
        inspiration from contemporary pulp fiction and characters like Zorro and the Shadow, establishing Batman as a master
        detective with a dark, brooding persona driven by the murder of his parents.[8][9]
        
        Golden, Silver and Bronze Ages
        See also: List of Batman comics
        Batman debuted in Detective Comics #27 in 1939. Early stories were dark, featuring a Batman who did not shy away from
        killing. The character quickly became popular, leading to his own solo title in 1940. Robin, Batman's sidekick, was
        introduced in 1940, lightening the tone and boosting sales. Over the next few years, Batman's rogues' gallery expanded
        with iconic villains like the Joker and Catwoman. The 1950s saw Batman in lighter, science fiction-influenced stories.
        However, declining sales led to a 1964 revamp by editor Julius Schwartz, who returned Batman to his detective roots and
        updated his appearance. The 1966 Batman TV series introduced a campy, humorous tone, which was reflected in the comics
        until its cancellation in 1968. In the 1970s, writers Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams restored Batman's dark, gritty
        nature, a trend that continued despite fluctuating sales.
        
        Modern Age and reboots
        In the Modern Age of Comic Books Batman comics have undergone significant transformations, reflecting changing
        storytelling trends and audience interests. Beginning with seminal works like The Dark Knight Returns in the 1980s,[10]
        which reintroduced Batman in a grittier, more mature context, the character's narrative evolved to explore deeper themes
        and darker tones.[11] This period also saw the exploration of Batman's origins and psyche through works like Batman:
        Year One,[11][12] and Batman: The Killing Joke, which delved into the complexities of heroism and villainy.[13] In the
        1990s, storylines such as "Knightfall" introduced new adversaries like Bane, who physically and mentally challenged
        Batman, leading to a temporary replacement by Jean-Paul Valley. The aftermath of an earthquake in "No Man's Land"
        depicted Gotham City in chaos, further pushing Batman to new limits of heroism and survival.[14] Entering the 21st
        century, Grant Morrison's influential run introduced Damian Wayne as Batman's son and heir, bringing familial dynamics
        and a new generation of challenges to the forefront. Morrison's storytelling also delved into surreal and existential
        themes, such as in Batman R.I.P. and Final Crisis, which tested Batman's resolve and sanity against cosmic threats and
        personal demons.[15][16] The New 52 reboot in 2011 refreshed Batman's continuity while preserving core elements of his
        character. This era introduced modern interpretations of classic storylines, like Night of the Owls, where Batman
        confronts the Court of Owls, a clandestine society controlling Gotham for centuries. The chilling return of the Joker in
        "Death of the Family" explored the intricate relationships within Batman's extended family of allies and adversaries.
        More recent developments under DC Rebirth and Infinite Frontier have continued to evolve Batman's universe, exploring
        new characters like Gotham and Gotham Girl, and tackling contemporary issues within the context of Gotham City's
        ever-evolving landscape of crime and heroism.[17]
        
        Characterization
        Bruce Wayne
        "Bruce Wayne" redirects here. For other uses, see Bruce Wayne (disambiguation).
        
        DC Comics concept art of Bruce Wayne by Mikel Janín
        Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his
        parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona and seek justice
        against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal residence, Wayne Manor. Wayne averts
        suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune and the profits of Wayne
        Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate.[18][19] He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne
        Foundation, which in part addresses social issues encouraging crime as well as assisting victims of it, but is more
        widely known as a celebrity socialite.[20] In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which
        encourages tabloid gossip while feigning near-drunkenness with consuming large quantities of disguised ginger ale since
        Wayne is actually a strict teetotaler to maintain his physical and mental prowess.[21] Although Bruce Wayne leads an
        active romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman account for most of his time.[22]
        
        Various modern stories have portrayed the extravagant, playboy image of Bruce Wayne as a facade.[23] This is in contrast
        to the Post-Crisis Superman, whose Clark Kent persona is the true identity, while the Superman persona is the
        facade.[24][25] In Batman Unmasked, a television documentary about the psychology of the character, behavioral scientist
        Benjamin Karney notes that Batman's personality is driven by Bruce Wayne's inherent humanity; that "Batman, for all its
        benefits and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it, is ultimately a tool for Bruce Wayne's efforts to make the
        world better". Bruce Wayne's principles include the desire to prevent future harm and a vow not to kill. Bruce Wayne
        believes that our actions define us, we fail for a reason, and anything is possible.[26]
        
        Writers of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two. Interpretations vary depending on the
        writer, the story, and the timing. Grant Morrison[27] notes that both heroes "believe in the same kind of things"
        despite the day/night contrast their heroic roles display. Morrison notes an equally stark contrast in their real
        identities. Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social classes: "Bruce has a butler, Clark has a boss." T.
        James Musler's book Unleashing the Superhero in Us All explores the extent to which Bruce Wayne's vast personal wealth
        is important in his life story, and the crucial role it plays in his efforts as Batman.[28]
        
        Will Brooker notes in his book Batman Unmasked that "the confirmation of the Batman's identity lies with the young
        audience ...he doesn't have to be Bruce Wayne; he just needs the suit and gadgets, the abilities, and most importantly
        the morality, the humanity. There's just a sense about him: 'they trust him ...and they're never wrong."[29]
        
        Personality
        Batman's primary character traits can be summarized as "wealth; physical prowess; deductive abilities and
        obsession".[30] The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years with different creative teams.
        Dennis O'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes: "Julie Schwartz
        did a Batman in Batman and Detective and Murray Boltinoff did a Batman in the Brave and the Bold and apart from the
        costume they bore very little resemblance to each other. Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts, nor
        were they asked to do so. Continuity was not important in those days."[31]
        
        The driving force behind Bruce Wayne's character is his parents' murder and their absence. Bob Kane and Bill Finger
        discussed Batman's background and decided that "there's nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before
        your eyes".[32] Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist[33][34] and to train his body
        into physical perfection[33][34] to fight crime in Gotham City as Batman, an inspired idea from Wayne's insight into the
        criminal mind.[33][34] He also speaks over 40 languages.[35]
        
        Another of Batman's characterizations is that of a vigilante; in order to stop evil that started with the death of his
        parents, he must sometimes break the law himself. Although manifested differently by being re-told by different artists,
        it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman's origin have never varied at all in the comic
        books, the "reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions".[36] The origin is
        the source of the character's traits and attributes, which play out in many of the character's adventures.[30]
        
        Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories. Frank Miller views the character as "a
        dionysian figure, a force for anarchy that imposes an individual order".[37] Dressed as a bat, Batman deliberately
        cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime-fighting,[38] a fear that originates from the criminals'
        own guilty conscience.[39] Miller is often credited with reintroducing anti-heroic traits into Batman's
        characterization,[40] such as his brooding personality, willingness to use violence and torture, and increasingly
        alienated behavior. Batman, shortly a year after his debut and the introduction of Robin, was changed in 1940 after DC
        editor Whitney Ellsworth felt the character would be tainted by his lethal methods and DC established their own ethical
        code, subsequently he was retconned to have a stringent moral code,[41][42] which has stayed with the character of
        Batman ever since. Miller's Batman was closer to the original pre-Robin version, who was willing to kill criminals if
        necessary.[43]
        
        Others
        On several occasions former Robin Dick Grayson has served as Batman; most notably in 2009 while Wayne was believed dead,
        and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in 2010.[44] As part of DC's 2011 continuity relaunch, Grayson
        returned to being Nightwing following the Flashpoint crossover event.
        
        In an interview with IGN, Morrison detailed that having Dick Grayson as Batman and Damian Wayne as Robin represented a
        "reverse" of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin, with, "a more light-hearted and spontaneous Batman and a
        scowling, badass Robin". Morrison explained their intentions for the new characterization of Batman: "Dick Grayson is
        kind of this consummate superhero. The guy has been Batman's partner since he was a kid, he's led the Teen Titans, and
        he's trained with everybody in the DC Universe. So he's a very different kind of Batman. He's a lot easier; He's a lot
        looser and more relaxed."[45]
        
        Over the years, there have been numerous others to assume the name of Batman, or to officially take over for Bruce
        during his leaves of absence. Jean-Paul Valley, also known as Azrael, assumed the cowl after the events of the
        Knightfall saga.[44] Jim Gordon donned a mecha-suit after the events of Batman: Endgame, and served as Batman in 2015
        and 2016. In 2021, as part of the Fear State crossover event, Lucius Fox's son Jace Fox succeeds Bruce as Batman in a
        2021 storyline, depicted in the series I Am Batman, after Batman was declared dead.
        
        Additionally, members of the group Batman Incorporated, Bruce Wayne's experiment at franchising his brand of
        vigilantism, have at times stood in as the official Batman in cities around the world.[44] Various others have also
        taken up the role of Batman in stories set in alternative universes and possible futures, including, among them, various
        former proteges of Bruce Wayne.
        
        Supporting characters
        Main article: List of Batman supporting characters
        Batman's interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of
        characters.[30]
        
        Enemies
        Main article: List of Batman family enemies
        Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains. Many of them mirror aspects of
        the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime.[46] These
        foes are commonly referred to as Batman's rogues gallery. Batman's "most implacable foe" is the Joker, a homicidal
        maniac with a clown-like appearance. The Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the
        antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while
        Batman has a serious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance. As a "personification of the irrational", the Joker
        represents "everything Batman [opposes]".[47] Other long-time recurring foes that are part of Batman's rogues gallery
        include Catwoman (a cat burglar anti-heroine who is variously an ally and romantic interest), the Penguin, Ra's al Ghul,
        Two-Face (Harvey Dent), the Riddler, the Scarecrow, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Bane, Clayface, and Killer
        Croc, among others. Many of Batman's adversaries are often psychiatric patients at Arkham Asylum.
        
        Allies
        Alfred Pennyworth, Batman's loyal butler and father figure, first appeared in Batman #16 (1943). After Bruce Wayne's
        parents were killed, Alfred raised Bruce and became one of the few people to know his secret identity. He is often
        portrayed as a steadying presence in Bruce's life, offering both emotional support and practical assistance in Batman's
        crime-fighting endeavors. More than just a caretaker, Alfred is a trusted ally and sometimes sidekick, sharing Wayne
        Manor with Bruce and contributing to Batman's mission.[46]
        
        One of Batman's most crucial allies is Commissioner James Gordon. Their relationship is built on mutual respect and a
        shared commitment to justice in Gotham City. In Batman: Year One, Gordon and Batman learn to trust each other, which
        transforms their efforts against crime into a more effective partnership. Gordon's perspective as a police officer
        complements Batman's vigilantism, allowing them to tackle Gotham's challenges together. Another important ally is the
        Justice League, which further emphasizes the importance of collaboration. Batman's relationship with Superman showcases
        how their contrasting ideologies can complement each other. In stories like World's Finest, their friendship highlights
        how Batman's methods benefit from Superman's optimism and strength.[48]
        
        Sidekicks
        Main article: Robin (character)
        
        Batman and Robin, art by Jack Burnley
        Robin, Batman's vigilante partner, has been a widely recognized supporting character for many years; each iteration of
        the Robin character, of which there have been five in the mainstream continuity, function as members of the Batman
        family, but additionally, as Batman's "central" sidekick in various media.[49] Bill Finger stated that he wanted to
        include Robin because "Batman didn't have anyone to talk to, and it got a little tiresome always having him
        thinking."[50] The first Robin, Dick Grayson, was introduced in 1940. In the 1970s he finally grew up, went off to
        college and became the hero Nightwing. A second Robin, Jason Todd was introduced in the 1980s, following Dick Grayson's
        departure from the role. Initially impulsive and rebellious, Jason's tenure as Robin was controversial among fans. In
        1988, DC held a fan vote to determine his fate in the iconic A Death in the Family storyline, where the Joker brutally
        beat Jason with a crowbar and left him to die in an explosion. The fans voted for his death. However, Jason was later
        resurrected and returned as the antihero Red Hood.[51]
        
        The third Robin in the mainstream comics is Tim Drake, who first appeared in 1989. He went on to star in his own comic
        series, and goes by the name Red Robin, a variation on the traditional Robin persona. In the first decade of the new
        millennium, Stephanie Brown served as the fourth in-universe Robin between stints as her self-made vigilante identity
        the Spoiler, and later as Batgirl.[52] After Brown's apparent death, Drake resumed the role of Robin for a time. The
        role eventually passed to Damian Wayne, the 10-year-old son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul, in the late 2000s.[53]
        Damian's tenure as du jour Robin ended when the character was killed off in the pages of Batman Incorporated in
        2013.[54] Batman's next young sidekick is Harper Row, a streetwise young woman who avoids the name Robin but followed
        the ornithological theme nonetheless; she debuted the codename and identity of the Bluebird in 2014. Unlike the Robins,
        the Bluebird is willing and permitted to use a gun, albeit non-lethal; her weapon of choice is a modified rifle that
        fires taser rounds.[55] In 2015, a new series began titled We Are...Robin, focused on a group of teenagers using the
        Robin persona to fight crime in Gotham City. The most prominent of these, Duke Thomas, later becomes Batman's
        crimefighting partner as The Signal.[56]
        
        Romantic interests
        Batman's romantic history spans decades, filled with relationships that reflect his struggle between personal happiness
        and his duty as Gotham's protector. His first love interest was Julie Madison, introduced in Detective Comics #31
        (1939). Though engaged to Bruce Wayne, she left due to his distant and playboy persona, highlighting the conflict
        between Bruce's dual life and his desire for a normal relationship.[57]
        
        Selina Kyle, also known as Catwoman, is perhaps the most notable figure in Batman's romantic history. Debuting in Batman
        #1 (1940), their relationship is characterized by a blend of romance and rivalry. Over the years, they have shared
        intense connections, often navigating the fine line between love and conflict. Their relationship culminated in an
        engagement during the Rebirth era.[57]
        
        Another important figure is Vicki Vale, a journalist introduced in Batman #49 (1948). Vicki's attempts to uncover
        Batman's true identity lead to a complicated romantic involvement that waxed and waned over the years, especially during
        the early 1980s when their relationship became more serious.[57]
        
        Talia al Ghul, introduced in Detective Comics #411 (1971), is another key player in Batman's love life. Their
        relationship is fraught with conflict due to her father, Ra's al Ghul, and his criminal ambitions. Despite the
        challenges, their love story resulted in the birth of Damian Wayne, who would grow to become the latest Robin and add a
        new layer of complexity to Batman's character.[57]
        
        Additionally, Batman's relationship with Wonder Woman has been explored in various storylines, including a passionate
        kiss in JLA (2003) during a moment of crisis. However, their relationship remains largely unexplored, often overshadowed
        by their respective commitments.[58]
        
        One of the most controversial romantic pairings emerged from the animated adaptation of Batman: The Killing Joke (2016),
        which depicted a brief romantic involvement between Batman and Batgirl (Barbara Gordon). This portrayal sparked
        significant criticism among fans, reflecting the challenges and complexities of Batman's romantic entanglements over the
        years.[59]
        
        Abilities
        Skills and training
        Batman has no inherent superhuman powers; he relies on "his own scientific knowledge, detective skills, and athletic
        prowess".[60] Batman's inexhaustible wealth gives him access to advanced technologies, and as a proficient scientist, he
        is able to use and modify these technologies to his advantage. In the stories, Batman is regarded as one of the world's
        greatest detectives, if not the world's greatest crime solver.[61] Batman has been repeatedly described as having a
        genius-level intellect, being one of the greatest martial artists in the DC Universe, and having peak human physical and
        mental conditioning.[62] As a polymath, his knowledge and expertise in countless disciplines is nearly unparalleled by
        any other character in the DC Universe. He has shown prowess in assorted fields such as mathematics, biology, physics,
        chemistry, and several levels of engineering.[63] He has traveled the world acquiring the skills needed to aid him in
        his endeavors as Batman. In the Superman: Doomed story arc, Superman considers Batman to be one of the most brilliant
        minds on the planet.[64]
        
        Batman has trained extensively in various fighting styles, making him one of the best hand-to-hand fighters in the DC
        Universe. He possesses a photographic memory,[65] and has fully utilized his photographic memory to master a total of
        127 forms of martial arts.[66] In terms of his physical condition, Batman is described as peak human and far beyond an
        Olympic-athlete-level condition, able to perform feats such as easily running across rooftops in a Parkour-esque
        fashion, pressing thousands of pounds regularly, and even bench pressing six hundred pounds of soil and coffin in a
        poisoned and starved state. Superman describes Batman as "the most dangerous man on Earth", able to defeat an entire
        team of superpowered extraterrestrials by himself in order to rescue his imprisoned teammates in Grant Morrison's first
        storyline in JLA.
        
        Batman is strongly disciplined, and he has the ability to function under great physical pain and resist most forms of
        telepathy and mind control. He is a master of disguise, multilingual, and an expert in espionage, often gathering
        information under the identity of a notorious gangster named Matches Malone. Batman is highly skilled in stealth
        movement and escapology, which allows him to appear and disappear at will and to break free of nearly inescapable
        deathtraps with little to no harm. He is also a master strategist, considered DC's greatest tactician, with numerous
        plans in preparation for almost any eventuality.
        
        Batman is an expert in interrogation techniques and his intimidating and frightening appearance alone is often all that
        is needed in getting information from suspects. Despite having the potential to harm his enemies, Batman's most defining
        characteristic is his strong commitment to justice and his reluctance to take a life. This unyielding moral rectitude
        has earned him the respect of several heroes in the DC Universe, most notably that of Superman and Wonder Woman.
        
        Among physical and other crime fighting related training, he is also proficient at other types of skills. Some of these
        include being a licensed pilot (in order to operate the Batplane), as well as being able to operate other types of
        machinery. In some publications, he even underwent some magician training.
        
        Technology
        Batman utilizes a vast arsenal of specialized, high-tech vehicles and gadgets in his war against crime, the designs of
        which usually share a bat motif. Batman historian Les Daniels credits Gardner Fox with creating the concept of Batman's
        arsenal with the introduction of the utility belt in Detective Comics #29 (July 1939) and the first bat-themed weapons
        the batarang and the "Batgyro" in Detective Comics #31 and 32 (Sept. and October 1939).[67]
        
        Personal armor
        Main article: Batsuit
        Batman's batsuit aids in his combat against enemies, having the properties of both Kevlar and Nomex. It protects him
        from gunfire and other significant impacts, and incorporates the imagery of a bat in order to frighten criminals.[68]
        
        The details of the Batman costume change repeatedly through various decades, stories, media and artists'
        interpretations, but the most distinctive elements remain consistent: a scallop-hem cape; a cowl covering most of the
        face; a pair of bat-like ears; a stylized bat emblem on the chest; and the ever-present utility belt. His gloves
        typically feature three scallops that protrude from long, gauntlet-like cuffs, although in his earliest appearances he
        wore short, plain gloves without the scallops.[69] The overall look of the character, particularly the length of the
        cowl's ears and of the cape, varies greatly depending on the artist. Dennis O'Neil said, "We now say that Batman has two
        hundred suits hanging in the Batcave so they don't have to look the same ...Everybody loves to draw Batman, and
        everybody wants to put their own spin on it."[70]
        
        Finger and Kane originally conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in
        coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue.[68] Hence, the costume's colors have appeared in the comics as
        dark blue and grey;[68] as well as black and grey. In the Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns films, Batman has been
        depicted as completely black with a bat in the middle surrounded by a yellow background. Christopher Nolan's The Dark
        Knight Trilogy depicted Batman wearing high-tech gear painted completely black with a black bat in the middle. Ben
        Affleck's Batman in the DC Extended Universe films wears a suit grey in color with a black cowl, cape, and bat symbol.
        Seemingly following the suit of the DC Extended Universe outfit, Robert Pattinson's uniform in The Batman restores the
        more traditional gray bodysuit and black appendage design, notably different from prior iterations by mostly utilizing
        real world armor and apparel pieces from modern military and motorcycle gear.
        
        Batmobile
        Main article: Batmobile
        
        The 1966 television Batmobile, built by George Barris from a Lincoln Futura concept car
        Batman's primary vehicle is the Batmobile, which is usually depicted as an imposing black car, often with tailfins that
        suggest a bat's wings.
        
        Batman also has an aircraft called the Batplane (originally a relatively traditionally, but bat-motifed plane, later
        seen as the much more unique "Batwing" starting in the 1989 film), along with various other means of transportation.
        
        In proper practice, the "bat" prefix (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to
        his equipment, particularly after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s Batman live-action television show and the Super
        Friends animated series) stretched the practice to campy proportions. For example, the 1960s television show depicted a
        Batboat, Bat-Sub, and Batcycle, among other bat-themed vehicles. The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that
        includes such "bat-" names as the Bat-computer, Bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water
        dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, bat-shark repellent bat-spray, and Bat-rope. The storyline "A Death in
        the Family" suggests that given Batman's grim nature, he is unlikely to have adopted the "bat" prefix on his own. In The
        Dark Knight Returns, Batman tells Carrie Kelley that the original Robin came up with the name "Batmobile" when he was
        young, since that is what a kid would call Batman's vehicle.
        
        The Batmobile, which was before frequently depicted to resemble a sports car, was redesigned in 2011 when DC Comics
        relaunched its entire line of comic books, with the Batmobile being given heavier armor and new aesthetics.
        
        Utility belt
        Main article: Batman's utility belt
        Batman keeps most of his field equipment in his utility belt. Over the years it has shown to contain an assortment of
        crime-fighting tools, weapons, and investigative and technological instruments. Different versions of the belt have
        these items stored in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it.
        
        Since the 1989 film, Batman is often depicted as carrying a projectile which shoots a retractable grappling hook
        attached to a cable (before this, a he employed a traditionally thrown grappling hook.) This allows him to attach to
        distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City.
        
        An exception to the range of Batman's equipment are hand guns, which he refuses to use on principle, since a gun was
        used in his parents' murder. In modern stories in terms of his vehicles, Batman compromises on that principle to install
        weapon systems on them for the purpose of non-lethally disabling other vehicles, forcing entry into locations and
        attacking dangerous targets too large to defeat by other means.
        
        Bat-Signal
        Main article: Bat-Signal
        When Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a searchlight with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens called the
        Bat-Signal, which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point
        in Gotham. The origin of the signal varies, depending on the continuity and medium.
        
        In various incarnations, most notably the 1960s Batman TV series, Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line,
        dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a wooden base and has a
        transparent top. The line connects directly to Batman's residence, Wayne Manor, specifically both to a similar phone
        sitting on the desk in Bruce Wayne's study and the extension phone in the Batcave.
        
        Batcave
        Main article: Batcave
        The Batcave is Batman's secret headquarters, consisting of a series of caves beneath his mansion, Wayne Manor. As his
        command center, the Batcave serves multiple purposes; supercomputer, surveillance, redundant power-generators, forensics
        lab, medical infirmary, private study, training dojo, fabrication workshop, arsenal, hangar and garage. It houses the
        vehicles and equipment Batman uses in his campaign to fight crime. It is also a trophy room and storage facility for
        Batman's unique memorabilia collected over the years from various cases he has worked on.
        
        In both the comic book Batman: Shadow of the Bat #45 and the 2005 film Batman Begins, the cave is said to have been part
        of the Underground Railroad.
        
        Fictional character biography
        Batman's history has undergone many retroactive continuity revisions, both minor and major. Elements of the character's
        history have varied greatly. Scholars William Uricchio and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s, "Unlike some
        fictional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather existed in a plethora of
        equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades."[71]
        
        20th century
        Origin
        Main article: Origin of Batman
        
        Thomas and Martha Wayne are shot by Joe Chill in Detective Comics #33 (November 1939), art by Bob Kane
        The central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character's origin story.[30] As a young boy, Bruce Wayne was
        horrified and traumatized when he watched his parents, the physician Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, murdered with
        a gun by a mugger named Joe Chill. Batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to
        murder his parents. This event drove him to train his body to its peak condition and fight crime in Gotham City as
        Batman. Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, "Until
        recently, the fixed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number",[30] a situation altered by an
        increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories.[72]
        
        Golden Age
        See also: Batman (Earth-Two)
        In Batman's first appearance in Detective Comics #27, he is already operating as a crime-fighter.[73] Batman's origin is
        first presented in Detective Comics #33 (November 1939) and is later expanded upon in Batman #47. As these comics state,
        Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable Gotham City socialites.
        Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor, and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of 8, when his parents are
        killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill while on their way home from a movie theater. That night, Bruce Wayne
        swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime. He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he
        realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. "Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot", Wayne remarks, "so
        my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts. I must be a creature of the night, black, terrible ..." As
        if responding to his desires, a bat suddenly flies through the window, inspiring Bruce to craft the Batman persona.[74]
        
        In early strips, Batman's career as a vigilante earns him the ire of the police. During this period, Bruce Wayne has a
        fiancé named Julie Madison.[75] In Detective Comics #38, Wayne takes in an orphaned circus acrobat, Dick Grayson, who
        becomes his vigilante partner, Robin. Batman also becomes a founding member of the Justice Society of America,[76]
        although he, like Superman, is an honorary member,[77] and thus only participates occasionally. Batman's relationship
        with the law thaws quickly, and he is made an honorary member of Gotham City's police department.[78] During this time,
        Alfred Pennyworth arrives at Wayne Manor, and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities, joins their service as
        their butler.[79]
        
        Silver Age
        The Silver Age of Comic Books in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced Barry
        Allen as a new, updated version of the Flash. Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity
        which would be later referred to as Earth-One. The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and
        Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and
        Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until Detective Comics #327 (May 1964), in which
        Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series.
        
        After the introduction of DC Comics' Multiverse in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the
        Earth-Two Batman, a character from a parallel world. This version of Batman partners with and marries the reformed
        Earth-Two Catwoman (Selina Kyle). The two have a daughter, Helena Wayne, who becomes the Huntress. She assumes the
        position as Gotham's protector along with Dick Grayson, the Earth-Two Robin, once Bruce Wayne retires to become police
        commissioner. Wayne holds the position of police commissioner until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman.
        Batman titles, however, often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen
        (since unlike the Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and
        would occasionally make reference to stories from the Golden Age.[80] Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were
        altered or expanded upon through the decades. Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his
        upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in Batman #208 (February 1969)) after his parents' death, and
        appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively.[81][82] In 1980,
        then-editor Paul Levitz commissioned the Untold Legend of the Batman miniseries to thoroughly chronicle Batman's origin
        and history.
        
        Batman meets and regularly works with other heroes during the Silver Age, most notably Superman, whom he began regularly
        working alongside in a series of team-ups in World's Finest Comics, starting in 1954 and continuing through the series'
        cancellation in 1986. Batman and Superman are usually depicted as close friends. As a founding member of the Justice
        League of America, Batman appears in its first story, in 1960's The Brave and the Bold #28. In the 1970s and 1980s, The
        Brave and the Bold became a Batman title, in which Batman teams up with a different DC Universe superhero each month.
        
        Bronze Age
        In 1969, Dick Grayson attends college as part of DC Comics' effort to revise the Batman comics. Additionally, Batman
        also moves from his mansion, Wayne Manor into a penthouse apartment atop the Wayne Foundation building in downtown
        Gotham City, in order to be closer to Gotham City's crime. In 1974's "Night of the Stalker" storyline, a diploma on the
        wall reveals Bruce Wayne as a graduate of Yale Law School.[83] Batman spends the 1970s and early 1980s mainly working
        solo, with occasional team-ups with Robin or Batgirl. Batman's adventures also become somewhat darker and more grim
        during this period, depicting increasingly violent crimes, including the first appearance (since the early Golden Age)
        of the Joker as a homicidal psychopath, and the arrival of Ra's al Ghul, a centuries-old terrorist who knows Batman's
        secret identity. In the 1980s, Dick Grayson becomes Nightwing.[84]
        
        In the final issue of The Brave and the Bold in 1983, Batman quits the Justice League and forms a new group called the
        Outsiders. He serves as the team's leader until Batman and the Outsiders #32 (1986) and the comic subsequently changed
        its title.
        
        Modern Age
        After the 12-issue miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC Comics retconned the histories of some major characters in
        an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences. Frank Miller retold Batman's origin in the storyline "Year One"
        from Batman #404–407, which emphasizes a grittier tone in the character.[85] Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from
        history, many stories of Batman's Silver Age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of Golden Age ones) remain canonical
        in the Post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration. For example, Gotham's
        police are mostly corrupt, setting up further need for Batman's existence. The guardian Phillip Wayne is removed,
        leaving young Bruce to be raised by Alfred Pennyworth. Additionally, Batman is no longer a founding member of the
        Justice League of America, although he becomes leader for a short time of a new incarnation of the team launched in
        1987. To help fill in the revised backstory for Batman following Crisis, DC launched a new Batman title called Legends
        of the Dark Knight in 1989 and has published various miniseries and one-shot stories since then that largely take place
        during the "Year One" period.[86]
        
        Subsequently, Batman begins exhibiting an excessive, reckless approach to his crimefighting, a result of the pain of
        losing Jason Todd. Batman works solo until the decade's close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin.[87]
        
        Many of the major Batman storylines since the 1990s have been intertitle crossovers that run for a number of issues. In
        1993, DC published "Knightfall". During the storyline's first phase, the new villain Bane paralyzes Batman, leading
        Wayne to ask Azrael to take on the role. After the end of "Knightfall", the storylines split in two directions,
        following both the Azrael-Batman's adventures, and Bruce Wayne's quest to become Batman once more. The story arcs
        realign in "KnightsEnd", as Azrael becomes increasingly violent and is defeated by a healed Bruce Wayne. Wayne hands the
        Batman mantle to Dick Grayson (then Nightwing) for an interim period, while Wayne trains for a return to the role.[88]
        
        The 1994 company-wide crossover storyline Zero Hour: Crisis in Time! changes aspects of DC continuity again, including
        those of Batman. Noteworthy among these changes is that the general populace and the criminal element now consider
        Batman an urban legend rather than a known force.
        
        Batman once again becomes a member of the Justice League during Grant Morrison's 1996 relaunch of the series, titled
        JLA. During this time, Gotham City faces catastrophe in the decade's closing crossover arc. In 1998's "Cataclysm"
        storyline, Gotham City is devastated by an earthquake and ultimately cut off from the United States. Deprived of many of
        his technological resources, Batman fights to reclaim the city from legions of gangs during 1999's "No Man's Land".
        
        Meanwhile, Batman's relationship with the Gotham City Police Department changed for the worse with the events of
        "Batman: Officer Down" and "Batman: War Games/War Crimes"; Batman's long-time law enforcement allies Commissioner Gordon
        and Harvey Bullock are forced out of the police department in "Officer Down", while "War Games" and "War Crimes" saw
        Batman become a wanted fugitive after a contingency plan of his to neutralize Gotham City's criminal underworld is
        accidentally triggered, resulting in a massive gang war that ends with the sadistic Black Mask the undisputed ruler of
        the city's criminal gangs. Lex Luthor arranges for the murder of Batman's on-again, off-again love interest Vesper Lynd
        (introduced in the mid-1990s) during the "Bruce Wayne: Murderer?" and "Bruce Wayne: Fugitive" story arcs. Though Batman
        is able to clear his name, he loses another ally in the form of his new bodyguard Sasha, who is recruited into the
        organization known as "Checkmate" while stuck in prison due to her refusal to turn state's evidence against her
        employer. While he was unable to prove that Luthor was behind the murder of Vesper, Batman does get his revenge with
        help from Talia al Ghul in Superman/Batman #1–6.
        
        21st century
        2000s
        DC Comics' 2005 miniseries Identity Crisis reveals that JLA member Zatanna had edited Batman's memories to prevent him
        from stopping the Justice League from lobotomizing Dr. Light after he raped Sue Dibny. Batman later creates the Brother
        I satellite surveillance system to watch over and, if necessary, kill the other heroes after he remembered. The
        revelation of Batman's creation and his tacit responsibility for the Blue Beetle's death becomes a driving force in the
        lead-up to the Infinite Crisis miniseries, which again restructures DC continuity. Batman and a team of superheroes
        destroy Brother EYE and the OMACs, though, at the very end, Batman reaches his apparent breaking point when Alexander
        Luthor Jr. seriously wounds Nightwing. Picking up a gun, Batman nearly shoots Luthor in order to avenge his former
        sidekick, until Wonder Woman convinces him to not pull the trigger.
        
        Following Infinite Crisis, Bruce Wayne, Dick Grayson (having recovered from his wounds), and Tim Drake retrace the steps
        Bruce had taken when he originally left Gotham City, to "rebuild Batman".[89] In the Face the Face storyline, Batman and
        Robin return to Gotham City after their year-long absence. Part of this absence is captured during Week 30 of the 52
        series, which shows Batman fighting his inner demons.[90] Later on in 52, Batman is shown undergoing an intense
        meditation ritual in Nanda Parbat. This becomes an important part of the regular Batman title, which reveals that Batman
        is reborn as a more effective crime fighter while undergoing this ritual, having "hunted down and ate" the last traces
        of fear in his mind.[91][92] At the end of the "Face the Face" story arc, Bruce officially adopts Tim (who had lost both
        of his parents at various points in the character's history) as his son.[93] The follow-up story arc in Batman, Batman
        and Son, introduces Damian Wayne, who is Batman's son with Talia al Ghul. Although originally, in Batman: Son of the
        Demon, Bruce's coupling with Talia was implied to be consensual, this arc retconned it into Talia forcing herself on
        Bruce.[94]
        
        Batman, along with Superman and Wonder Woman, reforms the Justice League in the new Justice League of America
        series,[95] and is leading the newest incarnation of the Outsiders.[96]
        
        Grant Morrison's 2008 storyline, "Batman R.I.P." featured Batman being physically and mentally broken by the enigmatic
        villain Doctor Hurt and attracted news coverage in advance of its highly promoted conclusion, which would speculated to
        feature the death of Bruce Wayne.[97] However, though Batman is shown to possibly perish at the end of the arc, the
        two-issue arc "Last Rites", which leads into the crossover storyline "Final Crisis", shows that Batman survives his
        helicopter crash into the Gotham City River and returns to the Batcave, only to be summoned to the Hall of Justice by
        the JLA to help investigate the New God Orion's death. The story ends with Batman retrieving the god-killing bullet used
        to kill Orion, setting up its use in "Final Crisis".[98] In the pages of Final Crisis Batman is reduced to a charred
        skeleton.[99] In Final Crisis #7, Wayne is shown witnessing the passing of the first man, Anthro.[100][101] Wayne's
        "death" sets up the three-issue Battle for the Cowl miniseries in which Wayne's ex-proteges compete for the "right" to
        assume the role of Batman, which concludes with Grayson becoming Batman,[102] while Tim Drake takes on the identity of
        the Red Robin.[103] Dick and Damian continue as Batman and Robin, and in the crossover storyline "Blackest Night", what
        appears to be Bruce's corpse is reanimated as a Black Lantern zombie,[104] but is later shown that Bruce's corpse is one
        of Darkseid's failed Batman clones. Dick and Batman's other friends conclude that Bruce is alive.[105][106]
        
        2010s
        Bruce subsequently returned in Morrison's miniseries Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne, which depicted his travels
        through time from prehistory to present-day Gotham.[107][108][109] Bruce's return set up Batman Incorporated, an ongoing
        series which focused on Wayne franchising the Batman identity across the globe, allowing Dick and Damian to continue as
        Gotham's Dynamic Duo. Bruce publicly announced that Wayne Enterprises will aid Batman on his mission, known as "Batman,
        Incorporated". However, due to rebooted continuity that occurred as part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch of all of its comic
        books, The New 52, Dick Grayson was restored as Nightwing with Wayne serving as the sole Batman once again. The relaunch
        also interrupted the publication of Batman, Incorporated, which resumed its story in 2012–2013 with changes to suit the
        new status quo.
        
        The New 52
        During The New 52, all of DC's continuity was reset and the timeline was changed, making Batman the first superhero to
        emerge. This emergence took place during Zero Year, where Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham and becomes Batman, fighting the
        original Red Hood[110] and the Riddler.[111] In the present day, Batman discovers the Court of Owls, a secret
        organization operating in Gotham for decades.[112] Batman somewhat defeats the Court by defeating Owlman,[113] although
        the Court continues to operate on a smaller scale.[114] The Joker returns after losing the skin on his face (as shown in
        the opening issue of the second volume of Detective Comics) and attempts to kill the Batman's allies, though he is
        stopped by Batman.[115] After some time, Joker returns again, and both he and Batman die while fighting each other. Jim
        Gordon temporarily becomes Batman, using a high-tech suit, while it is revealed that an amnesiac Bruce Wayne is still
        alive.[citation needed] Gordon attempts to fight a new villain called Mr. Bloom, while Wayne, regains his memories with
        the help of Alfred Pennyworth and Julie Madison. Once with his memories, Wayne becomes Batman again and defeats Mr.
        Bloom with the help of Gordon.[citation needed]

        Batman on the variant cover of Detective Comics#1000 (May 2019). Art by Jason Fabok.
        The timeline was reset again during Rebirth, although no significant changes were made to the Batman mythos. [citation
        needed] Batman meets two new superheroes operating in Gotham named Gotham and Gotham Girl. Psycho-Pirate gets into
        Gotham's head and turns against Batman, and is finally defeated when he is killed. This event is very traumatic for
        Gotham Girl and she begins to lose her sanity.[116]
        
        Batman forms his own Suicide Squad, including Catwoman, and attempts to take down Bane. The mission is successful, and
        Batman breaks Bane's back.[117] Batman proposes to Catwoman.
        
        After healing from his wounds, an angry Bane travels to Gotham, where he fights Batman and loses.[118] Batman then tells
        Catwoman about the War of Jokes and Riddles, and she agrees to marry him.[119] Bane takes control of Arkham Asylum and
        manipulates Catwoman into leaving Wayne before the wedding.[120] This causes Wayne to become very angry, and, as Batman,
        lashes out against criminals, nearly killing Mr. Freeze.[121]
        
        Batman learns of Bane's control over Arkham and teams up with the Penguin to stop him.[122] Bane captures Batman, and
        Scarecrow causes him to hallucinate, although he eventually breaks free.[123] Batman escapes and reunites with Catwoman,
        while Bane captures and kills Alfred Pennyworth. Batman returns and defeats Bane, although too late to save Alfred.
        Gotham Girl prompts him to marry Catwoman.[124]
        
        It is revealed that the Joker who was working for Bane was really Clayface in disguise. The real Joker has been plotting
        a master plan to take over Gotham. This plan comes to fruition during The Joker War, in which Joker takes over the city.
        Batman defeats the Joker who vanishes after an explosion.[125] Ghost-Maker, an enemy from Batman's past, appears in
        Gotham, and, after a battle, becomes a sort of ally to Batman.[126] A new group called the Magistrate rises up in
        Gotham, led by Simon Saint, whose goal is to outlaw vigilantes such as Batman. At the same time, Scarecrow returns,[127]
        fighting Batman. During Fear State, Batman battles and defeats both Scarecrow and the Magistrate's Peacekeepers.
        
        Other versions
        Main article: Alternative versions of Batman
        The character of Batman has been portrayed in numerous alternative versions across various media since his debut in
        1939. These adaptations explore different facets and interpretations of the character.
        
        In the "Smallville" a television series, Bruce Wayne adopts the Batman persona in 2001, later teaming up with Superman
        and other superheroes.[128] Frank Miller's influential series, "The Dark Knight Returns," reimagines Batman as an older,
        more hardened vigilante, coming out of retirement to fight crime in a dystopian future.[129]
        
        In the "Injustice: Gods Among Us" universe, Batman leads a resistance against a tyrannical Superman who has taken
        control of Earth.
        
        The DC Bombshells series sets Batman in a World War II-era context, with Bruce Wayne taking inspiration from Batwoman to
        become the masked hero. The "Dark Multiverse" introduces various twisted versions of Batman, such as the Batman Who
        Laughs, a hybrid of Batman and the Joker, and Red Death, a fusion of Batman and the Flash.
        
        Other notable reimaginings include JLA/Avengers, where Batman appears in a crossover with Marvel's Avengers; Stan Lee's
        Just Imagine, which offers a completely different origin for Batman; and "Kingdom Come," where an older Batman operates
        in a dystopian future alongside other aged superheroes.
        
        In "Superman: American Alien," Bruce Wayne's journey is retold with significant differences, and "Batman: White Knight"
        explores a reality where the Joker is cured of his insanity and seeks to expose Batman as the true villain of Gotham.
        These various adaptations and reinterpretations highlight the versatility and enduring appeal of Batman as a character,
        allowing for a rich exploration of his mythology across different narratives and settings.
        
        In popular culture
        Main article: Batman in popular culture
        Batman has ascended to the status of a global pop culture phenomenon, transcending his origins in comic books. His
        influence expanded notably with the release of the 1989 film, which propelled him to the forefront of public
        consciousness through widespread merchandising. The Guardian describes Batman as emblematic of the constant reinvention
        characteristic of modern mass culture, embodying both iconic status and commercial appeal, making him a quintessential
        cultural artifact of the 21st century.[130]
        
        Media appearances
        Main article: Batman (franchise)
        Apart from comics, Batman's presence spans various mediums, including newspapers, radio dramas, television, stage, and
        film. From the 1940s serials to contemporary TV shows like "Gotham" and "Titans," Batman's legacy endures. Celebrating
        the character's 75th anniversary, Warner Bros released "Batman: Strange Days," showcasing his timeless appeal.[131]
        
        In September 2024, Batman become the first superhero to be given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was the
        2,790th star.[132]
        
        Different interpretations
        Further information: Homosexuality in the Batman franchise and Batman in popular culture § Psychological interpretation
        Gay interpretations of Batman have been studied academically since psychologist Fredric Wertham's claims in 1954.[133]
        Andy Medhurst and Will Brooker have explored Batman's appeal to gay audiences and the validity of a queer reading.[134]
        Meanwhile, in psychological interpretations, Dr. Travis Langley sees Batman as representing the "shadow archetype,"
        confronting inner darkness to fight evil, according to Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell's theories. Langley's analysis adds
        depth to Batman's psychological complexity.[135]

        <dt><b>Spider Man</b></dt>
        <dd>Spider-Man is a superhero in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and
        artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of
        Comic Books. He has been featured in comic books, television shows, films, video games, novels, and plays.
        
        Spider-Man has the secret identity of Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage high-school
        student and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents, Richard and Mary Parker,
        died in a plane crash. Lee, Ditko, and later creators had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and young
        adulthood and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic
        interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and
        Venom. In his origin story, Peter gets his superhuman spider powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive
        spider. These powers include superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance;
        clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability called
        "spider-sense". He builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which
        he uses both for fighting and travel, or "web swinging" across the city. Peter Parker initially used his powers for his
        personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that Peter could not stop, he began to use his powers to
        fight crime by becoming Spider-Man.
        
        Before Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the
        protagonist's sidekick role. The Spider-Man comic series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student
        from the Queens borough of New York City, as Spider-Man's secret identity, whose "self-obsessions with rejection,
        inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could relate.[8] While Spider-Man was a quintessential
        sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes Bucky Barnes and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America
        and Batman; he had learned the lesson for himself that "with great power comes great responsibility" —a line included in
        a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man's origin story, but later retroactively attributed to the late
        Uncle Ben Parker.
        
        Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing
        Spider-Man. Since his introduction, the main-continuity version of Peter has gone from a high school student to
        attending college to currently being somewhere in his late 20s. Peter has been a member of numerous superhero teams,
        most notably the Avengers and Fantastic Four. Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning
        2012–2014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die.[9] Marvel has also published comic books featuring
        alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the
        Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenage Peter Parker in the alternate
        universe; and Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man, which depicts a teenager named Miles Morales who takes up the mantle of
        Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's apparent death. Miles later became a superhero in his own right and was brought
        into mainstream continuity during the Secret Wars event, where he sometimes works alongside the mainline version of
        Peter.
        
        Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes.[10] He has appeared in countless forms of
        media, including several animated TV series: the first original animated series Spider-Man, with Paul Soles voicing the
        titular character, a live-action television series, syndicated newspaper comic strips, and multiple series of films.
        Spider-Man was first portrayed in live-action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories, a recurring skit on The Electric
        Company from 1974 to 1977.[11] In live-action films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire in Sam
        Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, by Andrew Garfield in two films directed by Marc Webb,[12] and in the Marvel Cinematic
        Universe by Tom Holland. Reeve Carney originally starred as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off
        the Dark.[13] Spider-Man was also voiced by Jake Johnson and Chris Pine in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the
        Spider-Verse, with the former reprising his role in the sequel, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.

        Creation and development
        A black and white picture of a man standing in front of a spider web.
        Richard Wentworth, a.k.a. the Spider in the pulp magazine The Spider. Stan Lee stated the Spider influenced the creation
        of Spider-Man.[14]
        In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting for a new
        superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books and the desire to
        create a character with whom teens could identify.[15]: 1  As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity
        to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing in comic books.[16] In his autobiography, Lee cites the
        non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great influence,[14]: 130 [17] and in a multitude of print
        and video interviews, Lee stated he was inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he
        has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true.[note 1] Besides the name, the Spider
        was wanted by both the law and the criminal underworld (a defining theme of Spider-Man's early years) and had through
        years of ceaseless struggle developed a "sixth sense", which warns him of danger, the inspiration for Spider-Man's
        "spider-sense".[17] Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with "boy", Lee says he
        chose "Spider-Man" because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and felt the name "Spider-Boy" would
        have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes.[18] He also decided to insert a hyphen in the name, as he
        felt it looked too similar to Superman, another superhero with a red and blue costume that starts with an "S" and ends
        with "man"[19] (although artist Steve Ditko intended the character to have an orange and purple costume).[20] At that
        time, Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character's approval. In a 1986
        interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman's objections.[note 2] Goodman eventually agreed to
        a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee, in numerous interviews, recalled as what would be the final issue of the
        science-fiction and supernatural anthology series Amazing Adult Fantasy, which was renamed Amazing Fantasy for issue #15
        (cover-dated August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962).[21] In particular, Lee stated that the fact that it had already been
        decided that Amazing Fantasy would be canceled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use
        Spider-Man.[18] While this was the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that "The
        Spider-Man ... will appear every month in Amazing."[21][22]
        
        Regardless, Lee received Goodman's approval for the name Spider-Man and the "ordinary teen" concept and approached
        artist Jack Kirby. As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which
        he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring
        that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby "immediately sat down for a story conference," Theakston writes, and
        Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages.[23] Steve Ditko would be the inker.[note 3]
        When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, "I hated the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badly—it
        just wasn't the character I wanted; it was too heroic".[23]: 12  Lee turned to Ditko, who developed an art style Lee
        found satisfactory. Ditko recalled:
        
        One of the first things I did was to work up a costume. A vital, visual part of the character. I had to know how he
        looked ... before I did any breakdowns. For example: A clinging power so he wouldn't have hard shoes or boots, a hidden
        wrist-shooter versus a web gun and holster, etc. ... I wasn't sure Stan would like the idea of covering the character's
        face but I did it because it hid an obviously boyish face. It would also add mystery to the character....[24]
        
        Although the interior artwork was by Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko's cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil a
        cover that Ditko inked.[21] As Lee explained in 2010, "I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had
        a lot of confidence in Jack's covers."[25]
        
        Cover art of Spider-Man, with big yellow letters "Amazing Fantasy".
        Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962) first introduced the character. It was a gateway to commercial success for the superhero
        and inspired the launch of The Amazing Spider-Man comic book. – Cover art by penciller Jack Kirby and inker Steve Ditko
        In an early recollection of the character's creation, Ditko described his and Lee's contributions in a mail interview
        with Gary Martin published in Comic Fan #2 (Summer 1965): "Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on
        wrist & spider signal."[26] At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an
        art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was
        "almost nil", he and Ditko had "worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created
        by Steve on his own ... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands."[23]: 14  Ditko claimed in
        a rare interview with Jonathan Ross that the costume was initially envisioned with an orange and purple color scheme,
        rather than the recognizable red and blue.[27]
        
        Kirby disputed Lee's version of the story and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character's creation. According
        to Kirby, the idea for Spider-Man had originated with Kirby and Joe Simon, who in the 1950s had developed a character
        called the Silver Spider for the Crestwood Publications comic Black Magic, but the character was left unused.[note 4]
        Simon, in his 1990 autobiography, disputed Kirby's account, asserting that Black Magic was not a factor and that Simon
        devised the name "Spider-Man" (later changed to "The Silver Spider"), while Kirby outlined the character's story and
        powers. Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby's character conception became the basis for Simon's Archie Comics
        superhero, the Fly.[28] Artist Steve Ditko stated that Lee liked the name Hawkman from DC Comics, and that "Spider-Man"
        was an outgrowth of that interest.[24]
        
        Simon concurred that Kirby had shown the original Spider-Man version to Lee, who liked the idea and assigned Kirby to
        draw sample pages of the new character, but disliked the results—in Simon's description, "Captain America with
        cobwebs".[note 5] Writer Mark Evanier notes that Lee's reasoning that Kirby's character was too heroic seems
        unlikely—Kirby still drew the covers for Amazing Fantasy #15 and the first issue of The Amazing Spider-Man. Evanier also
        disputes Kirby's given reason that he was "too busy" to draw Spider-Man in addition to his other duties, since Kirby
        was, said Evanier, "always busy".[29]: 127  Neither Lee's nor Kirby's explanation explains why key story elements like
        the magic ring were dropped; Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman,
        or one of his assistants, decided that Spider-Man, as drawn and envisioned by Kirby, was too similar to the
        Fly.[29]: 127 
        
        Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly. Ditko recalled that
        "Stan called Jack about the Fly", adding that "[d]ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel
        breakdowns from Stan's synopsis." It was at this point that the entire concept of the strip went through a major
        overhaul. "Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have
        contained." Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, where Ditko would expand
        upon to the point he became what Bell describes as "the first work for hire artist of his generation to create and
        control the narrative arc of his series". On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko stated, "I still don't know whose
        idea was Spider-Man".[30] Ditko did, however, view the published version of Spider-Man as a separate creation to the one
        he saw in the five pencilled pages that Kirby had completed. To support this, Ditko used the analogy of the Kirby/Marvel
        Thor, which was based on a name or idea of a character in Norse mythology: "If Marvel's Thor is a valid created work by
        Jack, his creation, then why isn't Spider-Man by Stan and me valid created work, our creation?" [31]
        
        Kirby noted in a 1971 interview that it was Ditko who "got Spider-Man to roll, and the thing caught on because of what
        he did".[32] Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, had acknowledged Ditko's role, stating, "If Steve wants to
        be called co-creator, I think he deserves [it]".[33] He has further commented that Ditko's costume design was key to the
        character's success; since the costume completely covers Spider-Man's body, people of all races could visualize
        themselves inside the costume and thus easily identify with the character.[18]
        
        Commercial success
        A few months after Spider-Man's introduction, publisher Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was
        shocked to find it was one of the nascent Marvel's highest-selling comics.[34]: 97  A solo ongoing series followed,
        beginning with The Amazing Spider-Man #1 (cover-dated March 1963). The title eventually became Marvel's top-selling
        series[8]: 211  with the character swiftly becoming a cultural icon; a 1965 Esquire poll of college campuses found that
        college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite
        revolutionary icons. One interviewee selected Spider-Man because he was "beset by woes, money problems, and the question
        of existence. In short, he is one of us."[8]: 223  Following Ditko's departure after issue #38 (July 1966), John Romita
        Sr. replaced him as penciller and would draw the series for the next several years. In 1968, Romita would also draw the
        character's extra-length stories in the comics magazine The Spectacular Spider-Man, a proto-graphic novel designed to
        appeal to older readers. It lasted for two issues and represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from
        the original series' summer Annuals that began in 1964.[35]
        
        An early 1970s Spider-Man story ultimately led to the revision of the Comics Code Authority. Previously, the Code
        forbade the depiction of the use of illegal drugs, even negatively. However, in 1970, the Nixon administration's
        Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel's
        top-selling titles.[8]: 239  Lee chose the top-selling The Amazing Spider-Man; issues #96–98 (May–July 1971) feature a
        story arc depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker's friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted
        to pills. When Spider-Man fights the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn, Harry's father), Spider-Man defeats him by revealing
        Harry's drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its
        seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority's approval or seal.
        The issues sold so well that the industry's self-censorship was undercut, and the Code was subsequently
        revised.[8]: 239 
        
        In 1972, a second monthly ongoing series starring Spider-Man began: Marvel Team-Up, in which Spider-Man was paired with
        other superheroes and supervillains.[36] From that point on, there have generally been at least two ongoing Spider-Man
        series at any time. In 1976, his second solo series, Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man, began running parallel to
        the main series.[37] A third series featuring Spider-Man, Web of Spider-Man, launched in 1985 to replace Marvel
        Team-Up.[38] The launch of a fourth monthly title in 1990, the "adjectiveless" Spider-Man (with the storyline
        "Torment"), written and drawn by popular artist Todd McFarlane, debuted with several different covers, all with the same
        interior content. All four versions combined sold over three million copies, an industry record at the time. Several
        miniseries, one-shot issues, and loosely related comics have also been published, and Spider-Man makes frequent cameos
        and guest appearances in other comic book series.[37][39] In 1996, The Sensational Spider-Man was created to replace Web
        of Spider-Man.[40]
        
        In 1998, writer-artist John Byrne revamped the origin of Spider-Man in the 13-issue limited series Spider-Man: Chapter
        One (Dec. 1998–Oct. 1999), similar to Byrne's adding details and some revisions to Superman's origin in DC Comics' The
        Man of Steel.[41] During that time, the original The Amazing Spider-Man ended with issue #441 (Nov. 1998), and The
        Amazing Spider-Man started with volume 2, #1 (Jan. 1999).[42] In 2003, Marvel reintroduced the original numbering for
        The Amazing Spider-Man and what would have been volume 2, #59, became issue #500 (Dec. 2003).[42]
        
        When the main series The Amazing Spider-Man reached issue #545 (Dec. 2007), Marvel dropped its spin-off ongoing series
        and instead began publishing The Amazing Spider-Man three times monthly, beginning with #546–548 (all January 2008).[43]
        The scheduling of The Amazing Spider-Man lasted until November 2010, when the comic book expanded from 22 pages to 30
        pages for each issue. Later on, The Amazing Spider-Man was published twice a month, beginning with #648–649 (both
        November 2010).[44][45] The following year, Marvel launched Avenging Spider-Man as the first spin-off ongoing series in
        addition to The Amazing Spider-Man, since the previous ones were canceled at the end of 2007.[43] The Amazing series
        temporarily ended with issue #700 in December 2012 and was replaced by The Superior Spider-Man, which had Doctor Octopus
        serve as the new Spider-Man by taking over Peter Parker's body. Superior was an enormous commercial success for
        Marvel,[46] and ran for 31 issues before the real Peter Parker returned in a newly relaunched The Amazing Spider-Man #1
        in April 2014.[47]
        
        Following the 2015 Secret Wars crossover event, a number of Spider-Man-related titles were either relaunched or created
        as part of the "All-New, All-Different Marvel" event. Among them, The Amazing Spider-Man was relaunched and primarily
        focuses on Peter Parker continuing to run Parker Industries and becomes a successful businessman who is operating
        worldwide.[48]
        
        Fictional character biography
        Early years
        In Forest Hills, Queens, New York City,[49] Midtown High School student Peter Benjamin Parker is a science-whiz orphan
        living with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. As depicted in Amazing Fantasy #15 (Aug. 1962), he is bitten by a radioactive
        spider (erroneously classified as an insect in the panel) at a science exhibit and "acquires the agility and
        proportionate strength of an arachnid".[50] Along with heightened athletic abilities, Parker gains the ability to adhere
        to walls and ceilings. Through his knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his
        own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker dons a
        costume and, as "Spider-Man", becomes a novelty television star. However, "[h]e blithely ignores the chance to stop a
        fleeing thief, [and] his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his
        Uncle Ben." Spider-Man tracks and subdues the killer and learns, in the story's next-to-last caption, "With great power
        there must also come—great responsibility!"[51]
        
        In the first issue of The Amazing Spider-Man (March 1963), despite his superpowers, Peter struggles to help his widowed
        Aunt May pay the rent, is taunted by Flash, and continues fighting crime and saving the city as Spider-Man, but his
        heroic deeds engender the editorial wrath of newspaper publisher of the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson, holds a grudge
        against Spider-Man, and continues making false statements about Spider-Man despite his heroism. Peter gets hired as a
        freelance photographer by Mr. Jameson to take pictures of Spider-Man, with him being unaware that Spider-Man is Peter
        Parker.[52][53] Spider-Man fights his enemies, including superpowered and non-superpowered supervillains—his archenemy
        and nemesis Green Goblin and then Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Chameleon, Lizard, Vulture, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, and
        Mysterio, defeating them one by one[54]—but Peter finds juggling his personal and superhero life difficult. In time,
        Peter graduates from high school[55] and enrolls at Empire State University (a fictional institution evoking the
        real-life Columbia University and New York University),[56] where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn and
        girlfriend Gwen Stacy,[57] and Aunt May introduces him to Mary Jane Watson.[54][58][59] As Peter deals with Harry's drug
        problems, and Harry's father, Norman Osborn, is revealed to be the Green Goblin, Peter attempts to give up his costumed
        identity for a while.[60][61] Gwen Stacy's father, New York City Police detective Captain George Stacy, is accidentally
        killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus (issue #90, November 1970).[62]
        
        1970s
        In issue #121 (June 1973),[54] the Green Goblin throws Gwen Stacy from a tower of either the Brooklyn Bridge (as
        depicted in the art) or the George Washington Bridge (as given in the text).[63][64] She dies during Spider-Man's rescue
        attempt, and Spider-Man swears revenge against his nemesis; a note on the letters page of issue #125 states: "It saddens
        us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey's webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed
        her."[65] The following issue, Spider-Man vengefully attacks and overpowers the Green Goblin, who kills himself
        accidentally in the ensuing battle with Spider-Man.[66]
        
        Working through his grief, Peter eventually develops tentative feelings toward Mary Jane, and the two "become confidants
        rather than lovers".[67] A romantic relationship eventually develops, with Parker proposing to her in issue #182 (July
        1978), and being turned down an issue later.[68] Peter went on to graduate from college in issue #185,[54] and becomes
        involved with the shy Debra Whitman and the extroverted, flirtatious costumed thief Felicia Hardy, a.k.a. the Black
        Cat,[69] whom he meets in issue #194 (July 1979).[54]
        
        1980s
        The black costume of Spider-Man.
        The Amazing Spider-Man #252 (May 1984): The black costume debut was controversial among fans. The suit was later
        revealed as an alien symbiote and was used in the creation of the villain Venom. – Cover art by Ron Frenz and Klaus
        Janson
        From 1984 to 1988, Spider-Man wore a black costume with a white spider design on his chest. The new costume originated
        in the Secret Wars miniseries on an alien planet where Spider-Man participates in a battle between Earth's major
        superheroes and supervillains.[70] He continues wearing the costume when he returns, starting in The Amazing Spider-Man
        #252. The change to a longstanding character's design met with controversy, "with many hardcore comics fans decrying it
        as tantamount to sacrilege. Spider-Man's traditional red and blue costume was iconic, they argued, on par with those of
        his D.C. rivals Superman and Batman."[71] The creators then revealed the costume was an alien symbiote, which Spider-Man
        rejects after a difficult struggle,[72] though the symbiote returns several times as Venom for revenge.[54] Peter
        proposes to Mary Jane in The Amazing Spider-Man #290 (July 1987), and she accepts two issues later, with the wedding
        taking place in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21 (1987)—promoted with a real-life mock wedding using actors at Shea
        Stadium, with Stan Lee officiating, on June 5, 1987.[73] David Michelinie, who scripted based on a plot by
        editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, said in 2007, "I didn't think they actually should [have gotten] married. ... I had
        actually planned another version, one that wasn't used."[73] Peter publishes a book of Spider-Man photographs called
        Webs,[74] and returns to his Empire State University graduate studies in biochemistry in #310 (Dec. 1988).[54]
        
        1990s
        In the controversial[75] 1990s storyline the "Clone Saga", a clone of Parker, created in 1970s comics by insane
        scientist Miles Warren, a.k.a. the Jackal, returns to New York City upon hearing of Aunt May's health worsening. The
        clone had lived incognito as Ben Reilly, but now assumes the superhero guise the Scarlet Spider and allies with Parker.
        To the surprise of both, new tests indicate Ben is the original and Peter is the clone.[76] Complicating matters, Mary
        Jane announces in The Spectacular Spider-Man #220 (Jan. 1995) that she is pregnant with Peter's baby.[54] Later,
        however, a resurrected Green Goblin (Norman Osborn) has Mary Jane poisoned, causing premature labor and the death of her
        and Peter's unborn daughter.[77] It is later revealed that The Green Goblin switched the results of the clone test in an
        attempt to destroy Peter's life by making him believe himself to be the clone. Ben is killed while saving Peter, in
        Peter Parker: Spider-Man #75 (Dec. 1996), and his body immediately crumbles into dust, confirming Ben was the clone.[77]
        
        In issue #97 (Nov. 1998) of the second series titled Peter Parker: Spider-Man,[78] Parker learns his Norman Osborn
        kidnapped Aunt May and her apparent death in The Amazing Spider-Man #400 (April 1995) had been a hoax.[79][80] Shortly
        afterward, in The Amazing Spider-Man (vol. 2) #13 (#454, Jan. 2000), Mary Jane is killed in an airplane explosion.[81]
        She is revealed to be alive in volume 2, issue #28 (#469, April 2001),[81] but she and Peter are completely separated in
        the following issue.[82]
        
        2000s
        Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski began writing The Amazing Spider-Man, illustrated by John Romita Jr., beginning
        with volume 2, #30 (#471, June 2001). Two issues later, Peter, now employed as a teacher at his old high school, meets
        the enigmatic Ezekiel Sims, who possesses similar spider powers and suggests that Peter, having gained such abilities,
        might not have been a fluke—that Parker has a connection to a totemic spider spirit. In vol. 2, #37 (#478, Jan. 2002),
        Aunt May discovers her nephew is Spider-Man.[80] Peter and Mary Jane reconcile in (vol. 2) #50 (#491, April 2003),[80]
        and in #512 (Nov. 2004)—the original issue numbering having returned with #500—Parker learns his late girlfriend Gwen
        Stacy had had two children with Norman Osborn.[83]
        
        He joins the superhero team The New Avengers in New Avengers #1–2. After a deranged, superpowered former high-school
        classmate destroys their respective homes, Peter, Mary Jane, and May move into Stark Tower, and Peter begins working as
        Tony Stark's assistant while freelancing for The Daily Bugle and continuing his teacher career. In the 12-part 2005
        story arc "The Other", Peter undergoes a transformation that evolves his powers. In the comic Civil War #2 (June 2006),
        part of the company-wide crossover arc of that title, the U.S. government's Superhuman Registration Act leads Spider-Man
        to reveal his true identity publicly. A growing unease about the Registration Act prompts him to escape with May and
        Mary Jane and joins the anti-registration underground.
        
        In issue #537 (Dec. 2006), Aunt May is critically wounded from Wilson Fisk's sniper, and enters into a coma. Peter,
        desperate to save her, exhausts all possibilities and makes a pact with the demon-lord Mephisto, who saves May's life in
        exchange for Peter and Mary Jane agreeing to have their marriage and all memory of it disappear. In this changed
        reality, Spider-Man's identity is secret once again, and in #545 (Jan. 2008), Mary Jane returns and is cold toward him.
        The controversial[84] storyline "One More Day" rolled back much of the fictional continuity at the behest of
        editor-in-chief Joe Quesada, who said, "Peter being single is an intrinsic part of the very foundation of the world of
        Spider-Man".[84] It caused unusual public friction between Quesada and writer Straczynski, who "told Joe that I was
        going to take my name off the last two issues of the [story] arc", but was talked out of doing so.[85] At issue with
        Straczynski's climax to the arc, Quesada said, was
        
        ...that we didn't receive the story and methodology to the resolution that we were all expecting. What made that very
        problematic is that we had four writers and artists well underway on [the sequel arc] "Brand New Day" that were
        expecting and needed "One More Day" to end in the way that we had all agreed it would. ... The fact that we had to ask
        for the story to move back to its original intent understandably made Joe upset and caused some major delays and page
        increases in the series. Also, the science that Joe was going to apply to the retcon of the marriage would have made
        over 30 years of Spider-Man books worthless, because they never would have had happened. ...[I]t would have reset way
        too many things outside of the Spider-Man titles. We just couldn't go there....[85]
        
        In this new continuity, designed to have very limited repercussions throughout the remainder of the Marvel Universe,
        Parker returns to work at the Daily Bugle, which has been renamed The DB under a new publisher.[86] He soon switches to
        the alternative press paper The Front Line.[87] J. Jonah Jameson becomes the Mayor of New York City in issue #591 (June
        2008).[83] Jonah's estranged father, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., marries May in issue #600 (Sept. 2009).[83][88]
        
        During the "Secret Invasion" by shape-shifting extraterrestrials, the Skrulls, Norman Osborn shoots and kills the Skrull
        queen Veranke.[89] He leverages this widely publicized success, positioning himself as the new director of the
        S.H.I.E.L.D.-like paramilitary force H.A.M.M.E.R. to advance his agenda,[89] while using his public image to start his
        own Dark Avengers. Norman, by himself, leads the Dark Avengers as the Iron Patriot, a suit of armor fashioned by himself
        after Iron Man's armor with Captain America's colors.[90]
        
        Harry is approached by Norman with the offer of a job within the Dark Avengers. It is later revealed that it is a ruse
        to coerce Harry into taking the American Son armor, whom Norman had planned to kill, in order to increase public
        sympathy. When Harry has the option of killing Norman, Spider-Man says to decapitate him, since Norman's healing factor
        may repair a blow to the head. Spider-Man also cautions Harry that killing Norman will cause Harry to "become the son
        Norman always wanted". Harry instead backs down, and turns away from his father forever.[91]
        
        2010s
        At Loki's suggestion, Norman Osborn creates a rationale to invade Asgard, claiming the world poses a national security
        threat. He is defeated, and ends up incarcerated in the Raft penitentiary.[92][93] A conflict between Spider-Man and
        Doctor Octopus over Osborn's son ends when it is revealed the child's father is Harry, who leaves town to raise him.[94]
        One of Doctor Octopus' Octobots swaps his and Spider-Man's personality, causing Peter to become trapped in the Doctor's
        dying body, while he in turn claimed Peter's life for himself. Though Peter failed to reverse the change, he manages to
        establish a weak link with the Doctor's mind, forcing him to relive all of his memories; Otto understands Peter's ideals
        of power and responsibility and swears to carry on with Peter's life with dignity as a "Superior" Spider-Man.[95][96]
        
        A portion of Peter survived in his original body in the form of a subconsciousness.[97] Later, realizing that he failed
        in his role as the "Superior" Spider-Man, Otto willingly allows Peter to reclaim his body in order to defeat Osborn and
        save Anna Maria Marconi, Otto's love.[98] In the aftermath of these events, Peter began to amend the relationships
        damaged by Otto's arrogance and negligence, both as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He additionally took up the reins of
        Parker Industries, a small company founded by Otto after leaving Horizon Labs.[99]
        
        Peter soon learns a second person had been bitten by the radioactive spider, Cindy Moon.[100] Spider-Man tracks her down
        and frees her from a bunker owned by the late Ezekiel Simms.[101] Not long after rescuing Cindy, who went on to adopt
        her own heroine identity as Silk,[102][103] Spider-Man encounters a contingent of spider-people from all over the
        Multiverse that banded together to fight the Inheritors, a group of psychic vampires who had begun to hunt down the
        spider-totems of other realities.[104] During a mission to gather more recruits in 2099, the Spider-Army stumbled upon
        another party of spider-people led by an alternate version of Otto Octavius.[105] Together, they neutralize the
        Inheritors.
        
        Peter then stops a nefarious plan put forward by the Jackal.[106] After the events of "Go Down Swinging", Peter's life
        was plagued with problems on both sides. As Spider-Man, Mayor Fisk publicly supports him, condemning all other
        vigilantes in order to isolate him from his superhero peers. As Peter Parker, his academic credentials were revoked
        after accusations of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation from Octavius, resulting in Peter being fired from the Daily
        Bugle. Subsequently, Peter became romantically involved with Mary Jane.[107] Briefly, Peter Parker and Spider-Man split
        into separate beings due to an accident involving the reverse-engineered Isotope Genome Accelerator. Peter eventually
        manages to reverse the process, and merges his two halves back together before the side-effects worsen and result in
        their death.[108]

        Further information: Last Remains
        Kindred uses the resurrected Sin-Eater's sins to possess Miles Morales, Spider-Gwen, Spider-Woman, Anya Corazon, and
        Julia Carpenter. Doctor Strange, who manages to restrain a possessed Silk, agrees to help Spider-Man. However, Peter
        dies when fighting Kindred. While dead, Peter's consciousness remembers the fateful day of the start of One More Day;
        Kindred is willing to resurrect Peter.[109]
        
        Personality and themes
        "People often say glibly that Marvel succeeded by blending super hero adventure stories with soap opera. What Lee and
        Ditko actually did in The Amazing Spider-Man was to make the series an ongoing novelistic chronicle of the lead
        character's life. Most super heroes had problems no more complex or relevant to their readers' lives than thwarting this
        month's bad guys... Parker had far more serious concern in his life: coming to terms with the death of a loved one,
        falling in love for the first time, struggling to make a living, and undergoing crises of conscience."
        
        Comics historian Peter Sanderson[110]
        
        Sally Kempton for the Village Voice opined in 1965 that "Spider-Man has a terrible identity problem, a marked
        inferiority complex, and a fear of women. He is antisocial, castration-ridden, racked with Oedipal guilt, and
        accident-prone ... [a] functioning neurotic".[49] Agonizing over his choices, always attempting to do right, he is
        nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who seem unsure as to whether he is a helpful vigilante or a
        clever criminal.[111]
        
        Cultural historian Bradford W. Wright notes:
        
        Spider-Man's plight was to be misunderstood and persecuted by the very public that he swore to protect. In the first
        issue of The Amazing Spider-Man, J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the Daily Bugle, launches an editorial campaign against
        the "Spider-Man menace". The resulting negative publicity exacerbates popular suspicions about the mysterious Spider-Man
        and makes it impossible for him to earn any more money by performing. Eventually, the bad press leads the authorities to
        brand him an outlaw. Ironically, Peter finally lands a job as a photographer for Jameson's Daily Bugle.[8]: 212 
        
        The mid-1960s stories reflect the political tensions of the time; early 1960s Marvel stories often deal with the Cold
        War and communism.[8]: 220–223  Wright writes:
        
        From his high-school beginnings to his entry into college life, Spider-Man remained the superhero most relevant to the
        world of young people. Fittingly, then, his comic book also contained some of the earliest references to the politics of
        young people. In 1968, in the wake of actual militant student demonstrations at Columbia University, Peter Parker finds
        himself in the midst of similar unrest at his Empire State University.... Peter has to reconcile his natural sympathy
        for the students with his assumed obligation to combat lawlessness as Spider-Man. As a law-upholding liberal, he finds
        himself caught between militant leftism and angry conservatives.[8]: 234–235 
        
        Powers, skills, and equipment
        Peter Parker has superhuman spider-powers and abilities derived from mutations resulting from the bite of a radioactive
        spider.[112] Since the original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man has had the ability to cling to walls. This has been
        speculated to be based on a distance-dependent interaction between his body and surfaces, known as the van der Waals
        force,[113] though in the 2002 Spider-Man film, his hands and feet are lined with tiny clinging cilia in the manner of a
        real spider's feet. Spider-Man's other powers include superhuman strength, agility, and balance and a precognitive sixth
        sense referred to as his "spider-sense", which alerts him to danger.[112]
        
        Spider-Man has a healing factor that allows him to recover from injuries sustained during battle.[114] In the aftermath
        of the 1989 "Acts of Vengeance" storyline, Spider-Man was said to have "superhuman recuperative abilities" that sped up
        his recovery from the exhaustion he suffered in defeating the Tri-Sentinel.[115]
        
        The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, and later writers have
        depicted his intellect at genius level.[116] Academically brilliant, Peter has expertise in the fields of applied
        science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, mathematics, and mechanics.
        
        With his talents, he sews his own costume to conceal his identity, and he constructs many devices that complement his
        powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters that allow him to shoot webs, swing at high speeds throughout the city, and
        navigate and trap his enemies with his webs, additionally with a spider-signal as a flashlight and a warning beacon to
        criminals.[112] Thomas Fireheart's scientists, world-renowned, are unable to replicate the fluid Parker created while in
        high school.[117]

        Sky-Spider
        In Marvel Comics Universe 2410, a boy named Petor was about to be born to a mother named Mari and a father named Rikkar,
        when suddenly an evil witch came to their village and contaminated the water well with her blood. Therefore, all the
        children of that village were born as mutants and monsters and were killed at birth. But Petor's mother did not want to
        kill him and raised him in the forest (without her husband knowing). 15 years later, the village was attacked by
        invaders called the Creons, so Petor came to the village to defend it. He managed to defeat the attackers, but he lost
        his mother and his father did not recognize him, and as a result, he was once again rejected from the village.
        
        Spider-Man from Earth-93165
        This Spider-Man was seen in What If...? V1 55, titled "What If... The Avengers Lost Operation Galactic Storm?" In fact,
        "Operation Galactic Storm" was one of the most important and controversial events of Marvel, which was published in
        1992. In this event, the Avengers get involved in a war between two alien races, the Kree and the Shi'ar. In this story,
        the Shi'ar detonate a bomb that kills millions of Kree. Then the Avengers realize that everything is under the
        supervision of a being called the Supreme Intelligence. They decide to execute him. Captain America strongly opposes
        this act. This controversial decision was unprecedented in the world of comics at that time. The Avengers manage to stop
        the killing of the Kree, but surprisingly, instead of thanking the Avengers, they attack and destroy Earth. In a panel,
        we see that Spider-Man takes the body of his wife, Mary Jane, and then everything is destroyed.

        Spider-Man in front of multiple characters' heads.
        Spider-Man contains a wide number of enemies and side characters. A variant cover art of The Amazing Spider-Man (vol. 3)
        #1 depicts the heads of various Spider-Man enemies behind Spider-Man (as drawn by Kevin Maguire), shown in the center.
        Spider-Man has had a large range of supporting characters introduced in the comics that are essential in the issues and
        storylines that star him. After his parents died, Peter Parker was raised by his loving aunt, May Parker, and his uncle
        and father figure, Ben Parker. After Uncle Ben is murdered by a burglar, Aunt May is virtually Peter's only family, and
        she and Peter are very close.[50]
        
        J. Jonah Jameson is the publisher of the Daily Bugle and Peter Parker's boss. A harsh critic of Spider-Man, he
        constantly features negative articles about the superhero in his newspaper. Despite his role as Jameson's editor and
        confidant, Robbie Robertson is always depicted as a supporter of both Spider-Man and his alter ego Peter Parker.[52]
        
        Eugene "Flash" Thompson is commonly depicted as Peter Parker's high school tormentor and bully, who idolizes Spider-Man,
        but is unaware that Spider-Man is Peter Parker. Later, he becomes a friend of Peter and adopts his own superhero
        identity, Agent Venom, after merging with the Venom symbiote.[52] Meanwhile, Harry Osborn, son of Norman Osborn, is most
        commonly recognized as Peter's best friend, although some versions depicted him as his rival.[54]
        
        Enemies
        Main article: List of Spider-Man enemies
        Writers and artists over the years have established a rogues gallery of supervillains to face Spider-Man, in comics and
        in other media. As with Spider-Man, the majority of the villains' powers originate with scientific accidents or the
        misuse of scientific technology, and many have animal-themed costumes or powers.[note 6] The following Spider-Man
        villains are listed in the ordering of their original chronological appearance:

        Unlike most superheroes, Spider-Man does not have a single villain with whom he has come into conflict the most.
        Instead, he is often regarded as having three archenemies:[165]
        
        ^ Doctor Octopus (a.k.a. Doc Ock) is a highly intelligent mad scientist who uses four mechanical appendages for both
        movement and combat. He has been described as Spider-Man's greatest enemy, and the man Peter Parker might have become if
        he had not been raised with a sense of responsibility.[15][166] Doc Ock is infamous for defeating him the first time in
        battle and for almost marrying Peter's Aunt May. He is also the core leader of the Sinister Six, and at one point
        adopted the "Master Planner" alias. ("If This Be My Destiny...!")[167] Later depictions revealed him in Peter Parker's
        body, where he was the titular character for a while.[166]
        ^ The Norman Osborn version of the Green Goblin is most commonly regarded as Spider-Man's arch-enemy.[165][168][169]
        While Norman is usually portrayed as an amoral industrialist and the head of the Oscorp scientific corporation, the
        Goblin is a psychopathic alternate personality, born after Norman's exposore to some unstable chemicals that also
        increased his strength and agility. The Goblin is a Halloween-themed villain, dressing up like an actual goblin and
        utilizing a large arsenal of high tech weapons, including a glider and pumpkin-shaped explosives. Unlike most villains,
        who only aim to kill Spider-Man, the Goblin also targets his loved ones and shows no remorse in killing them as long as
        it caused pain to Spider-Man. His most infamous feat is killing Spider-Man's girlfriend, in what became one of the most
        famous Spider-Man stories of all time and helped to end the Silver Age of Comic Books and begin the Bronze Age of Comic
        Books.[165] While the Goblin was killed in the same story, he returned in the 1990s to plague Spider-Man once again,
        committing more heinous acts (such as being involved in the murder of Aunt May). He also came into conflict with other
        heroes, such as the Avengers.[170] Norman is sometimes depicted as an enemy of Spider-Man, even when not being the Green
        Goblin.[171]
        ^ The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom is often regarded as Spider-Man's deadliest foe, and has been described as an
        evil mirror version of Spider-Man in many ways.[157][119][165] He is also among Spider-Man's most popular villains.[172]
        Originally a reporter who grew to despise Spider-Man, Eddie later came into contact with the Venom symbiote, which had
        been rejected by Spider-Man. The symbiote merges with Eddie and gives him the same powers as Spider-Man, in addition to
        making him immune to the web-slinger's "spider-sense". Venom's main goal is to ruin Peter Parker's life and mentally
        confuse him in any way he can.[160] The character has a sense of honor and justice, and later starred in his own comic
        book stories, where he is depicted as an antihero and has a desire to protect innocent people from harm. On several
        occasions, he and Spider-Man even put their differences aside and became allies.[157][173]
        Romantic interests
        Peter Parker's romantic interests range between his first crush, fellow high-school student Liz Allan,[52] to having his
        first date with Betty Brant,[174] secretary to the Daily Bugle newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson. After his breakup
        with Betty Brant, Peter eventually falls in love with his college girlfriend Gwen Stacy,[54][57] daughter of New York
        City Police Department detective Captain George Stacy, both of whom are later killed by supervillain enemies of
        Spider-Man.[62] Mary Jane Watson became Peter's best friend and eventually his wife.[73] Felicia Hardy, the Black Cat,
        is a reformed cat burglar who had been Spider-Man's sole superhuman girlfriend and partner at one point.[69]
        
        Children
        Over the course of the comics, Peter Parker had several biological children across different continuities, usually with
        Mary Jane Watson, including Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker) and Benjy Parker from the MC2 universe, and Spiderling (Annie
        Parker) from Earth-18119.[175][176]
        
        Alternate versions of Spider-Man
        Main article: Alternative versions of Spider-Man
        Within the Marvel Universe, there exists a multiverse with many variations of Spider-Man.[177] An early character
        included in the 1980s is the fictional anthropomorphic animal parody of Spider-Man as a pig named Spider-Ham (Peter
        Porker).[178] Many imprints of Spider-Men were created, like the futuristic version of Spider-Man in Marvel 2099 named
        Miguel O'Hara. In the Marvel Comics 2 imprint, Peter marries Mary Jane and has a daughter named Mayday Parker, who
        carries on Spider-Man's legacy, while Marvel Noir has a 1930s version of Peter Parker.[177][179][180] Other themed
        versions exist within the early 2000s, such as a Marvel Mangaverse version and an Indian version from Spider-Man: India,
        Pavitr Prabhakar.[177][181]
        
        Ultimate Spider-Man was a popular modern retelling of Spider-Man, Peter Parker. The version of Peter Parker would later
        be depicted as being killed off and replaced by a Black Hispanic Spider-Man named Miles Morales.[182]
        
        The storyline "Spider-Verse" brought back many alternate takes on Spider-Man and introduced many new ones, such as an
        alternate world where Gwen Stacy gets bitten by a radioactive spider instead, along with a British-themed version named
        Spider-UK, who is Billy Braddock from the Captain Britain Corps.[179][183]
        
        Legacy
        In The Creation of Spider-Man, comic book writer-editor and historian Paul Kupperberg calls the character's superpowers
        "nothing too original"; what was original was that outside his secret identity, he was a "nerdy high school
        student".[184]: 5  Going against typical superhero fare, Spider-Man included "heavy doses of soap-opera and elements of
        melodrama". Kupperberg feels that Lee and Ditko had created something new in the world of comics: "the flawed superhero
        with everyday problems". This idea spawned a comics revolution.[184]: 6  The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel's early
        1960s comic books, such as The Amazing Spider-Man, The Incredible Hulk, The Fantastic Four, and The X-Men ushered in a
        new type of superhero, very different from the certain and all-powerful superheroes before them, and changed the
        public's perception of them.[185] After the comics depicted a real address in Forest Hills, Queens, New York, as May
        Parker's residence, its residents received many letters from children to the superhero.[186]
        
        Spider-Man has become one of the most recognizable fictional characters in the world, and has been used to sell toys,
        games, cereal, candy, soap, and many other products.[187] He has been used as the company mascot. When Marvel became the
        first comic book company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991, The Wall Street Journal announced
        "Spider-Man is coming to Wall Street"; the event was in turn promoted with an actor in a Spider-Man costume accompanying
        Stan Lee to the Stock Exchange.[8]: 254  Since 1962, hundreds of millions of comics featuring the character have been
        sold around the world.[188] Spider-Man is the world's most profitable superhero.[189][needs update] In 2014, global
        retail sales of licensed products related to Spider-Man reached approximately $1.3 billion.[190] Comparatively, this
        amount exceeds the global licensing revenue of Batman, Superman, and the Avengers combined.[189]

        Spider-Man joined the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1987 to 1998 as one of the balloon floats,[191] designed by
        John Romita Sr.,[192] one of the character's signature artists. A new, different Spider-Man balloon float also appeared
        from 2009 to 2014.[191]
        
        When Marvel wanted to issue a story dealing with the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the company chose
        the December 2001 issue of The Amazing Spider-Man.[193] In 2006, Spider-Man garnered major media coverage with the
        revelation of the character's secret identity,[194] an event detailed in a full-page story in the New York Post before
        the issue containing the story was even released.[195]
        
        In 2008, Marvel announced plans to release a series of educational comics the following year in partnership with the
        United Nations, depicting Spider-Man alongside the UN Peacekeeping Forces to highlight UN peacekeeping missions.[196] A
        BusinessWeek article listed Spider-Man as one of the top 10 most intelligent fictional characters in American
        comics.[197]
        
        In 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, a case concerning royalties
        on a patent for an imitation web shooter. The opinion for the Court, by Justice Elena Kagan, included several Spider-Man
        references, concluding with the statement that "with great power, there must also come—great responsibility".[198]
        
        Spider-Man has become a subject of scientific inquiry. In 1987, researchers at Loyola University conducted a study into
        the utility of Spider-Man comics for informing children and parents about issues relating to child abuse.[199]
        
        Reception
        The culmination of nearly every superhero that came before him, Spider-Man is the hero of heroes. He's got fun and cool
        powers, but not on the god-like level of Thor. He's just a normal guy with girlfriend problems and money issues, so he's
        more relatable than playboy billionaire Iron Man. And he's an awkward teenager, not a wizened adult like Captain
        America. Not too hot and not too cold, Spider-Man is just right.
        
        —IGN staff on placing Spider-Man as the number one hero of Marvel.[200]
        
        In 2005, Bravo's Ultimate Super Heroes, Vixens, and Villains TV series declared that Spider-Man was the number 1
        superhero.[201] Empire magazine ranked him the fifth-greatest comic book character of all time.[202] Wizard magazine
        placed Spider-Man as the third-greatest comic book character on their website.[203] In 2011, Spider-Man placed third on
        IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time, behind DC Comics characters Superman and Batman,[200] and sixth in their
        2012 list of "The Top 50 Avengers".[204] In 2014, IGN identified Spider-Man the greatest Marvel Comics character of all
        time.[205] A 2015 poll at Comic Book Resources named Spider-Man the greatest Marvel character of all time.[206] IGN
        described him as the common everyman that represents many normal people, but also noted his uniqueness compared to many
        superheroes with his depicted flaws as a superhero. IGN wrote that despite being one of the most tragic superheroes of
        all time, he is "one of the most fun and snarky superheroes in existence."[200] Empire praised Spider-Man's
        always-present sense of humor and wisecracks in the face of the many tragedies he faces. The magazine website appraised
        the depiction of his "iconic" superhero poses, describing it as "a top artist's dream".[203]
        
        George Marston of Newsarama called Spider-Man's origin the greatest origin story of all time, opining that "Spider-Man's
        origin combines all of the most classic aspects of pathos, tragedy and scientific wonder into the perfect blend for a
        superhero origin."[207]
        
        Real-life comparisons
        Real-life people who have been compared to Spider-Man for their climbing feats include:
        
        In 1981, skyscraper-safety activist Dan Goodwin, wearing a Spider-Man suit, scaled the Sears Tower in Chicago, Illinois,
        the Renaissance Tower in Dallas, Texas, and the John Hancock Center in Chicago.[208]
        Alain Robert, nicknamed "Spider-Man", is a rock and urban climber who has scaled more than 70 tall buildings using his
        hands and feet, without using additional devices. He sometimes wears a Spider-Man suit during his climbs. In May 2003,
        he was paid approximately $18,000 to climb the 95-metre (312 ft) Lloyd's building to promote the premiere of the movie
        Spider-Man on the British television channel Sky Movies.[209]
        "The Human Spider", alias Bill Strother, scaled the Lamar Building in Augusta, Georgia, in 1921.[210]
        In Argentina, criminals that climb buildings and trespass into private property through the open balconies are said to
        use the "Spider-Man method" (in Spanish, el Hombre Araña).[211][212]

        Spider-Man has appeared in comics, cartoons, films, video games, coloring books, novels, records, children's books, and
        theme park rides.[187] On television, he first starred in the ABC animated series Spider-Man (1967–1970),[213] Spidey
        Super Stories (1974–1977) on PBS, and the CBS live-action series The Amazing Spider-Man (1978–1979), starring Nicholas
        Hammond. Other animated series featuring the superhero include the syndicated Spider-Man (1981–1982), Spider-Man and His

        Spider-Man (2017–2020), and Spidey and His Amazing Friends (2021–present).
        
        A tokusatsu series featuring Spider-Man was produced by Toei and aired in Japan. It is commonly referred to by its
        Japanese pronunciation Supaidā-Man.[215] Spider-Man also appeared in other print forms besides the comics, including
        novels, children's books, and the daily newspaper comic strip The Amazing Spider-Man, which debuted in January 1977,
        with the earliest installments written by Stan Lee and drawn by John Romita Sr.[216] Spider-Man has been adapted to
        other media including games, toys, collectibles, and miscellaneous memorabilia, and has appeared as the main character
        in numerous computer and video games on over 15 gaming platforms.
        
        Spider-Man was featured in a trilogy of live-action films directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire as the
        titular superhero. The first Spider-Man film of the trilogy was released on May 3, 2002, followed by Spider-Man 2 (2004)
        and Spider-Man 3 (2007). A third sequel was originally scheduled to be released in 2011; however, Sony later decided to
        reboot the franchise with a new director and cast. The reboot, titled The Amazing Spider-Man, was released on July 3,
        2012, directed by Marc Webb, and starred Andrew Garfield as the new Spider-Man.[217][218][219] It was followed by The
        Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014).[220][221] In 2015, Sony and Disney made a deal for Spider-Man to appear in the Marvel
        Cinematic Universe.[222] Tom Holland made his debut as Spider-Man in the MCU film Captain America: Civil War (2016),
        before later starring in his standalone film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), directed by Jon Watts.[223][224] Holland
        reprised his role as Spider-Man in Avengers: Infinity War (2018),[225][226] Avengers: Endgame (2019),[227] Spider-Man:
        Far From Home (2019),[228] and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021); Maguire and Garfield reprise their roles in the latter
        film.[229] Jake Johnson voiced an alternate universe version of Spider-Man in the animated film Spider-Man: Into the
        Spider-Verse,[230] and reprised the role in its sequel Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023). Chris Pine also
        voiced another version of Peter Parker in Into the Spider-Verse.[231]
        
        Following a brief contract dispute over financial terms, in 2019, Sony and Disney reached a deal to allow Spider-Man to
        return to the MCU, with the two studios jointly producing Spider-Man films.[232]
        
        A Broadway musical, Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, began previews on November 14, 2010, at the Foxwoods Theatre on
        Broadway, with the official opening night on June 14, 2011.[233][234] The music and lyrics were written by Bono and The
        Edge of the rock group U2, with a book by Julie Taymor, Glen Berger, and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa.[235] Turn Off the Dark
        is currently the most expensive musical in Broadway history, costing an estimated $70 million.[236] In addition, the
        show's unusually high running costs are reported to have been about $1.2 million per week.[237]
        
        In the fine arts, since the Pop Art period of the 1960s, the character of Spider-Man has been "appropriated" by multiple
        visual artists and incorporated into contemporary artwork, including Andy Warhol,[238][239] Roy Lichtenstein,[240] Mel
        Ramos,[241] Vijay,[242] Dulce Pinzon,[243] Mr. Brainwash,[244] and F. Lennox Campello.[245]

        Brooklyn, NY; ISBN 1-56685-011-8), p. 12 (unnumbered). "He gave me 1,000 reasons why Spider-Man would never work. Nobody
        likes spiders; it sounds too much like Superman, and how could a teenager be a superhero? Then I told him I wanted the
        character to be a very human guy, someone who makes mistakes, who worries, who gets acne, has trouble with his
        girlfriend, and things like that. [Goodman replied,] 'He's a hero! He's not an average man!' I said, 'No, we make him an
        average man who happens to have superpowers, that's what will make him good.' He told me I was crazy".
        Ditko, Steve (2000). Roy Thomas (ed.). Alter Ego: The Comic Book Artist Collection. TwoMorrows Publishing. ISBN
        978-1-893905-06-1. "'Stan said a new Marvel hero would be introduced in #15 [of what became titled Amazing Fantasy]. He
        would be called Spider-Man. Jack would do the penciling, and I was to ink the character.' At this point still, Stan said
        Spider-Man would be a teenager with a magic ring that could transform him into an adult hero—Spider-Man. I said it
        sounded like the Fly, which Joe Simon had done for Archie Comics. Stan called Jack about it, but I don't know what was
        discussed. I never talked to Jack about Spider-Man... Later, at some point, I was given the job of drawing Spider-Man'".
        Jack Kirby in "Shop Talk: Jack Kirby", Will Eisner's Spirit Magazine #39 (February 1982): "Spider-Man was discussed
        between Joe Simon and myself. It was the last thing Joe, and I had discussed. We had a strip called 'The Silver Spider.'
        The Silver Spider was going into a magazine called Black Magic. Black Magic folded with Crestwood (Simon & Kirby's 1950s
        comics company) and we were left with the script. I believe I said this could become a thing called Spider-Man, see, a
        superhero character. I had a lot of faith in the superhero character that they could be brought back... and I said
        Spider-Man would be a fine character to start with. But Joe had already moved on. So the idea was already there when I
        talked to Stan".
        Simon, Joe, with Jim Simon. The Comic Book Makers (Crestwood/II, 1990) ISBN 1-887591-35-4. "There were a few holes in
        Jack's never-dependable memory. For instance, there was no Black Magic involved at all. ... Jack brought in the
        Spider-Man logo that I had loaned to him before we changed the name to The Silver Spider. Kirby laid out the story to
        Lee about the kid who finds a ring in a spiderweb, gets his powers from the ring, and goes forth to fight crime armed
        with The Silver Spider's old web-spinning pistol. Stan Lee said, 'Perfect, just what I want.' After obtaining permission
        from publisher Martin Goodman, Lee told Kirby to pencil-up an origin story. Kirby... using parts of an old rejected
        superhero named Night Fighter... revamped the old Silver Spider script, including revisions suggested by Lee. But when
        Kirby showed Lee the sample pages, it was Lee's turn to gripe. He had been expecting a skinny young kid who is
        transformed into a skinny young kid with spider powers. Kirby had him turn into... Captain America with cobwebs. He
        turned Spider-Man over to Steve Ditko, who... ignored Kirby's pages, tossed the character's magic ring, web pistol and
        goggles... and completely redesigned Spider-Man's costume and equipment. In this life, he became high-school student
        Peter Parker, who gets his spider powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. ... Lastly, the Spider-Man logo was
        redone and a dashing hyphen added".

        In Marvel comics, the term "mutate" is used as a noun to designate characters that received superpowers from an external
        source, as opposed to Marvel's mutants.

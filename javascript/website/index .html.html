    Pizza (Italian: [pittsa], Neapolitan: ['pittsa]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,
    flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat,etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. [1] A small pizza is sometimes
    called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

    A hamburger, or simply a burger, is a dish consisting of fillings-usually a patty of ground meat, typically
    beef-placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. The patties are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
    pickles, bacon, or chilis with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish or a "special sauce", often a
    variation of Thousand Island dressing, and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with
    cheese is called a cheeseburger. Under some definitions, and in some cultures, a burger is considered a sandwich.
